# DSA Problem 37

'''
Problem Statement:
Arun has a collection of unique colored marbles. He wants to know how many different ways he can exchange an even number of his marbles with his friend, keeping in mind that the order of exchange does not matter (i.e., exchanging marbles A and B is the same as exchanging B and A). Given the total number of marbles, n, and the number of different colors, k, can you help Arun find the total number of unique exchanges he can make if he can use any number of marbles of each color? Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

For example, if n=3 and k=2, and the marbles are represented as A (color 1) and B (color 2), possible exchanges could be (A, B), (A, A, B, B), etc. Note that the exchange must have an even number of marbles.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= k <= 100
'''

Solution:
```python
def count_unique_exchanges(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # If no even number of exchanges can be made, return 0.
    if n == 1:
        return 0

    # Calculate the number of unique exchanges using combinatorics.
    # The total number of ways to choose items (with repetition allowed) is given by
    # (n+k-1) choose k, but we only want even numbers, so we adjust for that.
    total_ways = pow(2, n-1, MOD)  # Total ways considering even choices only.
    
    # For each color, we can choose to include it or not, but we need to ensure even count.
    # This is equivalent to choosing even subsets from a set of n items.
    even_ways = (total_ways + 1) // 2  # Adjust for even subsets.
    
    return (even_ways * pow(k, n, MOD)) % MOD

# Example check (This is not part of the solution, just for verification)
print(count_unique_exchanges(4, 3))  # Example input
```

Note: The provided solution code simplifies the complex combinatorial problem into a more manageable form by leveraging properties of binary choices and modular arithmetic to efficiently compute the result within the constraints.
