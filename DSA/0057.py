# DSA Problem 57

'''
Problem Statement:
You are given a list of integers representing the heights of trees in a row. You can make a single cut on exactly one of the trees, dividing it into two trees. After the cut, the height of the tree you cut will be the height of the cut portion, and the remaining part will be the height of the original tree minus the cut height. Your goal is to maximize the product of the heights of the two tallest trees after the cut. Return this maximum product.

Note:
- The height of the trees is at least 1.
- The list of tree heights is non-empty and contains at least one tree.
- The maximum product of the heights of the two tallest trees after the cut should not exceed 10^9.
'''

Solution:
def max_product_after_cut(tree_heights):
    # Sort the tree heights to easily find the two tallest trees.
    tree_heights.sort(reverse=True)
    n = len(tree_heights)
    
    # Initially, the maximum product is the product of the tallest two trees.
    max_product = tree_heights[0] * tree_heights[1]
    
    # Check if cutting the tallest tree can give a better product.
    for i in range(n):
        # For each tree, check all possible cuts (from cutting 1 unit to cutting all but 1 unit).
        for cut in range(1, tree_heights[i]):
            # Calculate the product of the two resulting trees after cut.
            product = max(cut, tree_heights[i] - cut) * max(tree_heights[0], tree_heights[1])
            if i == 0 or i == 1:
                product = max(cut, tree_heights[i] - cut) * max(tree_heights[0] if i != 0 else tree_heights[1], tree_heights[1] if i != 1 else tree_heights[0])
            max_product = max(max_product, product)
            if max_product > 10**9:
                return max_product % (10**9 + 7)
    
    return max_product % (10**9 + 7)

# Example usage
tree_heights = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
print(max_product_after_cut(tree_heights))  # Output should be 12, by cutting the tree of height 5 into 2 and 3.

This problem and solution follow a unique setup around the concept of maximizing the product of the two tallest trees after making a cut on one of the trees. The solution involves sorting the list to find the tallest trees and then iterating over each tree and each possible cut to find the maximum product that does not exceed 10^9. The result is returned modulo 10^9 + 7 to handle large numbers.
