# DSA Problem 269

'''
Problem Statement:
A group of students are participating in a mathematics competition. Each student is given a list of unique positive integers. The task is to find the maximum number of integers one can pick from the list so that the sum of any two picked integers is not present in the original list.

For example, if the list of integers is [3, 5, 7, 10], one could pick [3, 7] or [5, 10] but not [3, 5, 7] because 3 + 5 = 8 is not in the list but 5 + 3 = 8 is not a valid concern as 8 was not originally in the list. Find the size of the largest set of integers that can be picked under these rules.

Constraints:
- The list will contain between 1 and 50 numbers.
- Each number in the list will be between 1 and 1000.
'''

Solution:
```python
def max_picks(numbers):
    """
    Finds the maximum number of integers one can pick from the list so that the sum of any two integers is not in the list.
    """
    numbers.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(numbers)
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i):
            if numbers[i] + numbers[j] not in numbers:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)

# Example check function
def check_solution():
    assert max_picks([4, 5, 8, 10]) == 2, "Test case 1 failed"
    assert max_picks([3, 5, 7, 10]) == 2, "Test case 2 failed"
    assert max_picks([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 3, "Test case 3 failed"
    print("All test cases passed!")

check_solution()
```

This problem solution revolves around dynamic programming and checks for every possible subset of numbers which satisfies the given condition, ensuring that the sum of any two picked numbers is not present in the given list.
