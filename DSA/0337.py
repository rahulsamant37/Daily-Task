# DSA Problem 337

'''
Problem Statement:
Given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum frequency of an element after you may modify at most `k` elements in the list. Each modification allows you to change an element to any other integer.

For example, if nums = [1,2,4,4,2] and k = 2, you can change one 1 to 2 and one 4 to 2 to make the list [2,2,4,2,2], which has the maximum frequency of 4 (element 2 appears 4 times).

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
- 0 <= k <= 10^9
'''

Solution:
```python
def maxFrequency(nums, k):
    nums.sort()
    max_freq = 0
    left = 0
    total = 0
    
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        total += nums[right]
        
        # Ensure that the current window satisfies the condition
        while ((right - left + 1) * nums[right] - total) > k:
            total -= nums[left]
            left += 1
        
        # Update the maximum frequency found so far
        max_freq = max(max_freq, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_freq

# Example check (This is not part of the solution, just for verification)
print(maxFrequency([1,2,4,4,2], 2))  # Expected output: 4
```

Explanation:
The solution uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum length of a subarray where the sum of the subarray can be made equal to the last element of the subarray multiplied by the length of the subarray with at most `k` changes. The `total` variable keeps track of the sum of the current window, and the window is adjusted to ensure that the condition is met.
