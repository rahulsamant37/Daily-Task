# Recap
With Query, Path (and others you haven't seen yet) you can declare metadata and string validations in the same ways as with Query Parameters and String Validations.

And you can also declare numeric validations:

- gt: greater than
- ge: greater than or equal
- lt: less than
- le: less than or equal
