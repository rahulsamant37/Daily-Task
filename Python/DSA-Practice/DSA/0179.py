# DSA Problem 179

'''
Problem Statement:
A triplet (a, b, c) is special if it satisfies the following conditions:
- a, b, and c are all distinct positive integers.
- a + b + c is divisible by 5.
- The product a * b * c is less than 1000.

Given two integers `start` and `end`, find the total number of special triplets such that each element of the triplet is in the range [start, end].

For example, if start = 1 and end = 5, the valid special triplets are (1, 2, 2) and (1, 3, 1) among others, but remember, a, b, and c must be distinct, so some of these might not be valid.
'''

Solution:
```python
def count_special_triplets(start, end):
    count = 0
    for a in range(start, end + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, end + 1):  # Ensure b is greater than a for distinctness
            for c in range(b + 1, end + 1):  # Ensure c is greater than b for distinctness
                if (a + b + c) % 5 == 0 and a * b * c < 1000:
                    count += 1
    return count

# Example check (the problem statement example does not match the constraints, so this is a separate check)
print(count_special_triplets(1, 10))  # Example output, this should be replaced with actual expected output
```

Note: The solution provided assumes that all values in the triplet must be distinct and each value within the range [start, end]. The example check at the end is for demonstration purposes and should be adjusted based on the actual expected output for that range.
