# DSA Problem 183

'''
Problem Statement:
You are given a list of integers, `nums`, and an integer `k`. You need to find the smallest possible difference between the maximum and minimum values of any k elements chosen from `nums`.

For example, if `nums = [1, 4, 7, 2]` and `k = 3`, you could choose the subset `[1, 2, 4]` or `[1, 2, 7]`, etc. Your task is to find the subset where the difference between the maximum and minimum values is the smallest possible.

Constraints:
- 2 <= len(nums) <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- 2 <= k <= len(nums)
'''

Solution:
```python
def smallest_difference(nums, k):
    """
    Finds the smallest possible difference between the maximum and minimum values
    of any k elements chosen from nums.
    """
    nums.sort()
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(nums) - k + 1):
        current_diff = nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i]
        min_diff = min(min_diff, current_diff)
    return min_diff

# Example check (You can run this to verify the correctness of the function)
print(smallest_difference([1, 4, 7, 2], 3))  # Output: 2
```

This Python solution first sorts the list of numbers to ensure that any subset of k elements considered in sequence will have its smallest possible difference between the maximum and minimum values. It then iterates over all possible subsets of size `k` and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values for each subset. The minimum of these differences is returned as the solution.
