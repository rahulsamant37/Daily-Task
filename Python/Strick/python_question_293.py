# Python Question: Longest Palindromic Substring
'''
Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

A palindromic substring is a substring that reads the same forwards and backward.

Example:
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

# Solution
def longest_palindrome(s):
    """
    Finds the longest palindromic substring within a given string.

    The approach used is dynamic programming. A 2D table `dp` is constructed
    where dp[i][j] is True if the substring s[i:j+1] is a palindrome, and False otherwise.

    The table is filled diagonally.  dp[i][i] is always True (single characters are palindromes).
    dp[i][i+1] is True if s[i] == s[i+1].  For substrings of length 3 or greater,
    dp[i][j] is True if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i+1][j-1] is True.

    The longest palindromic substring is tracked during the table filling process.
