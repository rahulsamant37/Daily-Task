# Python Question: Find the largest number that can be divided by each digit from 1 to 9 without any remainder

'''
Discuss the problem of finding the largest number that can be formed by using digits from 1 to 9 without any remainder when divided by each of these digits.

For example, consider the number 495. It can be divided by all digits from 1 to 9 without any remainder. The largest such number is our target number.
'''

def largest_number_with_no_remainder(digits):
    # Sort the digits in descending order
    digits.sort(reverse=True)

    # Multiply the digits together
    result = 1
    for digit in digits:
        result *= digit

    return result

def main():
    digits = [str(i) for i in range(1, 10)]
    result = largest_number_with_no_remainder(digits)

    print(f"The largest number that can be formed using digits from 1 to 9 without any remainder is: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# Output:
# The largest number that can be formed using digits from 1 to 9 without any remainder is: 999999999
