# Python Question: Fibonacci Series till a given number using recursion
'''
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns the Fibonacci series till that number using recursion.

Example:

Input: n = 5
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]

Input: n = 8
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
