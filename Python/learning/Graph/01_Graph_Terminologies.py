Graph Terminologies Overview

This documentation provides definitions of common terminologies used in graph theory:

1. Graph (G): A collection of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between nodes).
   Notation: G = (V, E), where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges.

2. Vertex (Node): A fundamental unit represented as a point in the graph. Vertices may store data.

3. Edge: A connection between two vertices. Can have a direction or be without direction.

4. Adjacent Vertices (Neighbors): Two vertices connected by an edge.

5. Degree:
   - In-degree: Number of incoming edges to a vertex.
   - Out-degree: Number of outgoing edges from a vertex.
   - Degree: Total number of edges connected to a vertex.

6. Path: A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge.
   - Simple Path: A path with no repeated vertices.

7. Cycle: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no other repetitions.

8. Subgraph: A graph formed from a subset of the vertices and edges of a larger graph.

9. Multigraph: A graph that allows multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.

10. Loop: An edge that connects a vertex to itself.

These terms form the foundational language for working with and analyzing graph-based structures in computer science, mathematics, and related fields.
