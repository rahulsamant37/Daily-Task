# Python Question: Finding the longest substring common to two given strings
'''
Given two strings, find the length of the longest substring that is common to both strings. If no such substring exists, return 0.

Example:
Input: A = "abcdef", B = "acdef"
Output: 3 (The longest common substring is 'ac')

Input: A = "abcef", B = "edc"
Output: 2 (The longest common substring is 'ec')

Input: A = "abcd", B = "ab"
Output: 2 (The longest common substring is 'ab')
