# Python Question: Word Ladder
'''
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the length of the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the wordList.

Return 0 if no such transformation sequence exists.

Example:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
