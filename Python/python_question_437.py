# Python Question: Longest Increasing Subsequence with Specific Difference
'''
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `diff`, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence where the difference between consecutive elements in the subsequence is exactly `diff`.

Example:
Input: nums = [3, 0, 3, 2, 4, 5], diff = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence with a difference of 1 is [2, 3, 4] or [4, 5]. So the length is 3.

Input: nums = [1, 5, 7, 8, 5, 3, 4, 2, 1], diff = -2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence with a difference of -2 is [7, 5, 3, 1]. So the length is 4.
