# Python Question: Longest Palindromic Subsequence
'''
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence's length in `s`.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

Example:
Input: "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

Input: "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
