# Python Question: Longest Palindromic Subsequence
'''
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

Example:
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
