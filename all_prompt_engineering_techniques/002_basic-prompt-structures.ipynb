    "# Basic Prompt Structures Tutorial\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on two fundamental types of prompt structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single-turn prompts\n",
    "2. Multi-turn prompts (conversations)\n",
    "We'll use Gemini model and LangChain to demonstrate these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "Understanding different prompt structures is crucial for effective communication with AI models. Single-turn prompts are useful for quick, straightforward queries, while multi-turn prompts enable more complex, context-aware interactions. Mastering these structures allows for more versatile and effective use of AI in various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "1. **Single-turn Prompts**: One-shot interactions with the language model.\n",
    "2. **Multi-turn Prompts**: Series of interactions that maintain context.\n",
    "3. **Prompt Templates**: Reusable structures for consistent prompting.\n",
    "4. **Conversation Chains**: Maintaining context across multiple interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Details\n",
    "We'll use a combination of Gemini and LangChain library to demonstrate these prompt structures. The tutorial will include practical examples and comparisons of different prompt types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "First, let's import the necessary libraries and set up our environment."

      "\n",
      "*   **Volume:** This is where the size difference really becomes apparent. Jupiter's volume is about 1,321 times greater than Earth's. That means you could fit over 1,300 Earths *inside* Jupiter! Imagine trying to pack that many Earths into one giant sphere!\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Mass:** Jupiter's mass is about 318 times greater than Earth's. So, it would take almost 318 Earths to equal the mass of Jupiter.\n",

      "So, to recap:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Diameter:** Jupiter is 11 Earths across.\n",
      "*   **Volume:** Jupiter can hold 1,321 Earths.\n",
      "*   **Mass:** Jupiter weighs as much as 318 Earths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, Jupiter is so much bigger than Earth that it dwarfs our planet in every way. It's a true giant of our solar system! Did you find these comparisons helpful, or would you like me to compare some other aspects of the two planets?\n"

Now, it's one of the most recognizable structures in the world and attracts millions of visitors every year.
