    "# Prompt Templates and Variables Tutorial (Using Jinja2)\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to creating and using prompt templates with variables in the context of AI language models. It focuses on leveraging Python and the Jinja2 templating engine to create flexible, reusable prompt structures that can incorporate dynamic content. The tutorial demonstrates how to interact with OpenAI's GPT models using these advanced prompting techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "As AI language models become increasingly sophisticated, the ability to craft effective prompts becomes crucial for obtaining desired outputs. Prompt templates and variables offer several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reusability: Templates can be reused across different contexts, saving time and ensuring consistency.\n",
    "2. Flexibility: Variables allow for dynamic content insertion, making prompts adaptable to various scenarios.\n",
    "3. Complexity Management: Templates can handle complex structures, including conditional logic and loops, enabling more sophisticated interactions with AI models.\n",
    "4. Scalability: As applications grow, well-structured templates make it easier to manage and maintain large numbers of prompts.\n",
    "This tutorial aims to equip learners with the knowledge and skills to create powerful, flexible prompt templates, enhancing their ability to work effectively with AI language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "The tutorial covers several key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. PromptTemplate Class: A custom class that wraps Jinja2's Template class, providing a simple interface for creating and using templates.\n",
    "2. Jinja2 Templating: Utilization of Jinja2 for advanced templating features, including variable insertion, conditional statements, and loops.\n",
    "3. OpenAI API Integration: Direct use of the OpenAI API for sending prompts and receiving responses from GPT models.\n",
    "4. Variable Handling: Techniques for incorporating variables into templates and managing dynamic content.\n",
    "5. Conditional Logic: Implementation of if-else statements within templates to create context-aware prompts.\n",
    "6. Advanced Formatting: Methods for structuring complex prompts, including list formatting and multi-part instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Details\n",
    "The tutorial employs a step-by-step approach to introduce and demonstrate prompt templating concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup and Environment: The lesson begins by setting up the necessary libraries, including Jinja2 and the OpenAI API client.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Basic Template Creation: Introduction to creating simple templates with single and multiple variables using the custom PromptTemplate class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Variable Insertion: Demonstration of how to insert variables into templates using Jinja2's {{ variable }} syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Conditional Content: Exploration of using if-else statements in templates to create prompts that adapt based on provided variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. List Processing: Techniques for handling lists of items within templates, including iteration and formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Advanced Templating: Demonstration of more complex template structures, including nested conditions, loops, and multi-part prompts.\n",
    "\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Visual:**  A stylized heart shape formed by interconnected nodes (circles) and lines, resembling a simplified neural network.  The left side of the heart is primarily blue, transitioning to green on the right. The lines connecting the nodes can subtly change color along their length, blending blue and green.\n",
      "*   **Color Palette:**  A gradient of blues (e.g., #29ABE2, #0077B6) transitioning into greens (e.g., #8BC34A, #4CAF50).\n",
      "*   **Rationale:**  Combines the universal symbol of healthcare (the heart) with the core technology (AI/neural networks). The gradient represents growth, innovation, and the blending of technology and health. The clean lines make it easily recognizable at small sizes.\n",
      "*   **Strengths:**  Directly relates to both healthcare and AI. Memorable and unique.\n",
      "*   **Weaknesses:**  Could be interpreted as only relating to cardiovascular health if not properly contextualized.\n",

      "**Concept 2:  Geometric \"AI\" with a Pulse**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Visual:** The letters \"AI\" are formed using geometric shapes.  The \"A\" is a solid blue triangle, and the \"I\" is a green line with a small, rounded green circle above it (representing a pulse or a data point). The \"I\" could also be slightly curved to suggest growth and a positive trajectory.\n",
      "*   **Color Palette:**  Blue: #1976D2; Green: #66BB6A.\n",
      "*   **Rationale:**  Directly uses the abbreviation for Artificial Intelligence. The geometric shapes are modern and tech-forward. The rounded circle/pulse adds a human touch and connects to the healthcare aspect.  The simplicity ensures scalability.\n",

Where they overlap, a subtle lighter shade of either blue or green (or a blend of both) could be used to symbolize synergy.  The interlocking could also suggest a DNA double helix in a simplified form.\n",
      "*   **Color Palette:**  Blue: #2196F3; Green: #43A047\n",

      "**Concept 4:  Abstract Brain Tree**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Visual:** An abstract tree shape where the roots resemble a brain's hemispheres. The roots are blue and the branches are green. The branches can have small rounded ends.\n",
      "*   **Color Palette:** Blue: #3F51B5; Green: #4CAF50\n",
      "*   **Rationale:** Connects AI with the human brain and growth with the tree metaphor.\n",
      "*   **Strengths:** Evokes intelligence and growth.\n",
      "*   **Weaknesses:** May be too complex for small applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations for all Concepts:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Font Choice (if applicable):** If the logo includes text (e.g., the company name or tagline), choose a clean, modern, and legible sans-serif font.  Consider fonts like Roboto, Open Sans, or Montserrat.  The font should complement the logo's style.\n",
      "*   **Negative Space:**  Utilize negative space effectively to create visual interest and improve recognizability.\n",
      "*   **Scalability:**  Test the logo at various sizes (e.g., favicon, business card, website header) to ensure it remains clear and legible.\n",
      "*   **Variations:**  Create variations of the logo for different applications (e.g., a horizontal version, a vertical version, a monochrome version).\n",
      "*   **Target Audience:**  While these concepts are generally applicable, consider the specific target audience (e.g., doctors, patients, researchers) and refine the design accordingly.\n",
      "*   **Color Accessibility:** Ensure the chosen blue and green colors have sufficient contrast for users with visual impairments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Choose a Concept:** Select the concept that best aligns with the startup's brand identity and values.\n",
      "2.  **Refine the Design:**  Work with a graphic designer to refine the chosen concept, experiment with different color variations, and explore font options.\n",
      "3.  **Gather Feedback:**  Get feedback from potential customers and stakeholders to ensure the logo resonates with the target audience.\n",
      "4.  **Finalize the Logo:**  Once you are satisfied with the design, finalize the logo and create a style guide that outlines its usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps, you can create a logo that is both visually appealing and effective in representing your AI-driven healthcare startup. Remember that simplicity, relevance, and memorability are key to a successful logo design. Good luck!\n"
