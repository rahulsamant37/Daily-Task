    "# Task Decomposition in Prompts Tutorial\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This tutorial explores the concept of task decomposition in prompt engineering, focusing on techniques for breaking down complex tasks and chaining subtasks in prompts. These techniques are essential for effectively leveraging large language models to solve multi-step problems and perform complex reasoning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "As AI language models become more advanced, they are increasingly capable of handling complex tasks. However, these models often perform better when given clear, step-by-step instructions. Task decomposition is a powerful technique that allows us to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subtasks. This approach not only improves the model's performance but also enhances the interpretability and reliability of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "1. Breaking Down Complex Tasks: Techniques for analyzing and dividing complex problems into simpler subtasks.\n",
    "2. Chaining Subtasks: Methods for sequentially connecting multiple subtasks to solve a larger problem.\n",
    "3. Prompt Design for Subtasks: Crafting effective prompts for each decomposed subtask.\n",
    "4. Result Integration: Combining the outputs from individual subtasks to form a comprehensive solution.\n",
    "### Method Details\n",
    "The tutorial employs a step-by-step approach to demonstrate task decomposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Problem Analysis: We start by examining a complex task and identifying its component parts.\n",
    "2. Subtask Definition: We define clear, manageable subtasks that collectively address the main problem.\n",
    "3. Prompt Engineering: For each subtask, we create targeted prompts that guide the AI model.\n",
    "4. Sequential Execution: We implement a chain of prompts, where the output of one subtask feeds into the next.\n",
    "5. Result Synthesis: Finally, we combine the outputs from all subtasks to form a comprehensive solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the tutorial, we use practical examples to illustrate these concepts, demonstrating how task decomposition can be applied to various domains such as analysis, problem-solving, and creative tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, learners will have gained practical skills in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyzing complex tasks and breaking them down into manageable subtasks\n",
    "- Designing effective prompts for each subtask\n",
    "- Chaining prompts to guide an AI model through a multi-step reasoning process\n",
    "- Integrating results from multiple subtasks to solve complex problems\n",
    "\n",
    "These skills will enable more effective use of AI language models for complex problem-solving and enhance the overall quality and reliability of AI-assisted tasks.\n",
    "\n",

      "Profitability Analysis:\n",
      " Okay, let's analyze the company's profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Calculate the Profit Margin:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Profit Margin (Net Profit Margin) = (Net Income / Revenue) * 100\n",
      "\n",
      "Profit Margin = ($2,000,000 / $10,000,000) * 100\n",

      "**2. Analysis of Profitability:**\n",
      "\n",
      "A profit margin of 20% indicates that the company is retaining 20 cents of every dollar of revenue as profit after all expenses have been paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here's a brief analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Generally Good:** A 20% profit margin is generally considered a good and healthy profit margin. It suggests the company is efficient in managing its costs and converting revenue into profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Industry Context is Crucial:**  The real interpretation of this profit margin depends heavily on the industry the company operates in.\n",
      "    *   Some industries (e.g., software, pharmaceuticals) often have higher profit margins due to lower cost of goods sold and high value-added products/services.\n",
      "    *   Other industries (e.g., retail, manufacturing) tend to have lower profit margins due to higher operating costs and competitive pricing.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Comparison to Competitors:** To get a better understanding, it's important to compare this 20% profit margin to the average profit margins of its direct competitors and the industry as a whole. If the company's profit margin is higher than its competitors, it suggests a competitive advantage (e.g., better cost control, stronger brand, more efficient operations). If it's lower, it may indicate areas for improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Trend Analysis:** It's also important to analyze the trend of the profit margin over time. Is it increasing, decreasing, or staying consistent? A declining profit margin could be a warning sign of rising costs, increased competition, or pricing pressures.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The company has a respectable 20% profit margin. However, to fully assess its profitability, you need to compare it to industry benchmarks, competitors' performance, and the company's own historical performance. Without this context, it's difficult to definitively say whether the company's profitability is excellent, average, or needs improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liquidity Analysis:\n",
      " Okay, let's analyze the company's liquidity using the provided data.  While the data is limited, we can still calculate a key liquidity ratio and draw some basic conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Limitations of the Data:**\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to acknowledge that **Total Assets and Total Liabilities are not sufficient to perform a thorough liquidity analysis.**  Liquidity focuses on a company's *short-term* ability to meet its obligations.  We need data specifically about:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Current Assets:**  Assets that can be converted into cash within one year (e.g., cash, accounts receivable, inventory).\n",
      "*   **Current Liabilities:**  Obligations due within one year (e.g., accounts payable, short-term debt).\n",
      "\n",
      "Without these, we can only make a very general assessment.  We'll have to *assume* some relationship between total assets/liabilities and their current components.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Assumptions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we only have Total Assets and Total Liabilities, we'll have to make a simplifying assumption.  Let's assume that a reasonable portion of Total Assets is Current Assets and a reasonable portion of Total Liabilities is Current Liabilities. This is a HUGE assumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Assumption 1:** 40% of Total Assets are Current Assets.  This implies Current Assets = 0.40 * $15 million = $6 million\n",
      "*   **Assumption 2:** 60% of Total Liabilities are Current Liabilities. This implies Current Liabilities = 0.60 * $7 million = $4.2 million\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Calculation of Current Ratio (with Assumptions):**\n",
      "\n",
      "The current ratio is calculated as:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities**\n",
      "\n",
      "Using our assumed values:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Current Ratio = $6 million / $4.2 million = 1.43\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Analysis of Liquidity (Based on Assumptions):**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the calculated current ratio of 1.43 (and remember, this is *highly dependent* on our assumptions):\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Interpretation:** A current ratio of 1.43 suggests that the company has $1.43 of current assets for every $1 of current liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **General Assessment:** Generally, a current ratio between 1.5 and 2.0 is considered healthy.  A ratio below 1.0 might indicate potential liquidity problems, while a ratio significantly above 2.0 *could* suggest that the company isn't efficiently using its current assets (although this is not necessarily a bad thing).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Caveats:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Industry Specificity:** The ideal current ratio varies significantly by industry.  Industries with fast inventory turnover (e.g., grocery stores) can often operate with lower current ratios.  Industries with longer production cycles (e.g., construction) typically need higher ratios.\n",
      "    *   **Quality of Current Assets:** The *quality* of current assets is crucial.  For example, accounts receivable that are unlikely to be collected or obsolete inventory are not truly liquid.\n",
      "    *   **Timing:** Liquidity is a snapshot in time.  It can change rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the extremely limited data and our assumptions, the company *appears* to have adequate liquidity, but further analysis is needed. **It is impossible to make a definitive statement about the company's liquidity without knowing the actual values of Current Assets and Current Liabilities.** A proper assessment requires access to the company's balance sheet and ideally other financial statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To provide a meaningful analysis, you absolutely need the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Balance Sheet:**  The actual balance sheet is essential to obtain the real values of Current Assets and Current Liabilities.\n",
      "*   **Industry Benchmarks:**  Compare the company's current ratio to the average for its industry.\n",
      "*   **Trend Analysis:**  Look at the company's current ratio over time to identify any trends.\n",
      "*   **Cash Flow Statement:**  Review the cash flow statement to understand how the company generates and uses cash.\n",
      "*   **Notes to Financial Statements:**  Read the notes to the financial statements for important details about the company's accounting policies and potential risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cash Flow Analysis:\n",
      " A Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) of $3 million indicates that the company is generating cash from its core business activities.  This is generally a **positive sign** and suggests the business is profitable and efficient at converting sales into cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here's a brief analysis of the company's cash flow health based solely on this information:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Positive Indicator:** The company is generating cash from its operations, which is crucial for funding investments, paying down debt, and returning value to shareholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Self-Sufficiency:**  Positive CFO suggests the company is not reliant on external financing (like borrowing) to cover its day-to-day expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Limited Information:** Without additional context, such as the company's size, industry, and historical performance, it's difficult to assess the significance of this $3 million. For example, $3 million might be excellent for a small startup but insufficient for a large corporation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**To get a more complete picture of the company's cash flow health, you'd need to consider:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Cash Flow from Investing (CFI):**  Is the company investing in growth opportunities or selling off assets?\n",
      "*   **Cash Flow from Financing (CFF):** Is the company borrowing money or paying down debt?  Is it issuing stock or buying back shares?\n",
      "*   **Trend Analysis:**  How does the current CFO compare to previous periods?  Is it increasing or decreasing?\n",
      "*   **Industry Benchmarks:** How does the company's CFO compare to its competitors?\n",
      "*   **Net Income:** How does the CFO compare to the company's net income?  A significant difference might indicate issues with accrual accounting.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In conclusion, a CFO of $3 million is a good starting point, but further analysis is necessary to determine the overall health and sustainability of the company's cash flow.**\n"
