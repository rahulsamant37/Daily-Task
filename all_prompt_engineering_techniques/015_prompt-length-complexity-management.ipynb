      "\n",

      "3.  **Use Structured Data (JSON/YAML):**  Whenever possible, structure your input and output using JSON or YAML. This makes it easier for the LLM to parse instructions and provides a consistent format for extracting information.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Employ Few-Shot Learning Wisely:** Instead of providing extensive detailed instructions, provide a few representative examples demonstrating the desired input/output behavior. This is often more effective and concise.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Test Prompt Length and Performance:** Systematically test the performance of your LLM with varying prompt lengths.  Measure metrics like accuracy, response time, and cost (token usage) to find the optimal balance.\n"
