    "# Negative Prompting and Avoiding Undesired Outputs\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This tutorial explores the concept of negative prompting and techniques for avoiding undesired outputs when working with large language models. We'll focus on using Gemini models and the LangChain library to implement these strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "As AI language models become more powerful, it's crucial to guide their outputs effectively. Negative prompting allows us to specify what we don't want in the model's responses, helping to refine and control the generated content. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with sensitive topics, ensuring factual accuracy, or maintaining a specific tone or style in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "1. Using negative examples to guide the model\n",
    "2. Specifying exclusions in prompts\n",
    "3. Implementing constraints using LangChain\n",
    "4. Evaluating and refining negative prompts\n",
    "### Method Details\n",
    "We'll start by setting up our environment with the necessary libraries. Then, we'll explore different techniques for negative prompting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic negative examples: We'll demonstrate how to provide examples of undesired outputs to guide the model.\n",
    "2. Explicit exclusions: We'll use prompts that specifically state what should not be included in the response.\n",
    "3. Constraint implementation: Using LangChain, we'll create more complex prompts that enforce specific constraints on the output.\n",
    "4. Evaluation and refinement: We'll discuss methods to assess the effectiveness of our negative prompts and iteratively improve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the tutorial, we'll use practical examples to illustrate these concepts and provide code snippets for implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of negative prompting techniques and how to apply them to avoid undesired outputs from language models. These skills will enable you to create more controlled, accurate, and appropriate AI-generated content for various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "First, let's import the necessary libraries and set up our environment."

      "Regular exercise offers a wealth of benefits for overall well-being. It strengthens your cardiovascular system, improving blood flow and reducing the risk of certain diseases. Exercise boosts energy levels, helps improve sleep quality, and can enhance cognitive function, leading to better focus and memory. It also releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects and can help manage stress and anxiety. Engaging in physical activity contributes to a stronger body and a healthier, more resilient you.\n"
