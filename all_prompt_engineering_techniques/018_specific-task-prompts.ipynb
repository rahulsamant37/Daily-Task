    "# Prompts for Specific Tasks\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This tutorial explores the creation and use of prompts for specific tasks in natural language processing. We'll focus on four key areas: text summarization, question-answering, code generation, and creative writing. Using Gemini model and the LangChain library, we'll demonstrate how to craft effective prompts for each of these tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "As language models become more advanced, the ability to design task-specific prompts becomes increasingly valuable. Well-crafted prompts can significantly enhance the performance of AI models across various applications, from summarizing long documents to generating code and fostering creativity in writing. This tutorial aims to provide practical insights into prompt engineering for these diverse tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "1. Text Summarization Prompts: Techniques for condensing long texts while retaining key information.\n",
    "2. Question-Answering Prompts: Strategies for extracting specific information from given contexts.\n",
    "3. Code Generation Prompts: Methods for guiding AI models to produce accurate and functional code.\n",
    "4. Creative Writing Prompts: Approaches to stimulating imaginative and engaging written content.\n",
    "### Method Details\n",
    "This tutorial uses the Gemini model through the LangChain library. For each task type, we'll follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Design a prompt template tailored to the specific task.\n",
    "2. Implement the prompt using LangChain's PromptTemplate.\n",
    "3. Execute the prompt with sample inputs.\n",
    "4. Analyze the output and discuss potential improvements or variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore how different prompt structures and phrasings can influence the model's output for each task type. The tutorial will also touch upon best practices for prompt design in each context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to create effective prompts for text summarization, question-answering, code generation, and creative writing tasks. You'll be equipped with practical examples and insights that you can apply to your own projects, enhancing your ability to leverage AI language models for diverse applications. Remember that prompt engineering is both an art and a science - experimentation and iteration are key to finding the most effective prompts for your specific needs.\n",

      "Key improvements and explanations:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Clear Docstring:**  The function has a comprehensive docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, and return value, including the edge case. This is crucial for code maintainability and understanding.\n",
      "* **List Comprehension:** Uses a concise list comprehension `even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` to efficiently extract even numbers from the input list. This is more Pythonic than using a traditional `for` loop and `append`.\n",
      "* **Handles Empty List/No Even Numbers:**  The `if not even_numbers:` condition explicitly checks if the `even_numbers` list is empty.  If it is, it returns 0 as specified in the problem description.  This prevents a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to calculate the average of an empty list.  This is *critical* for robustness.\n",
      "* **Handles Floats:**  The code now correctly handles lists containing floating-point numbers, ensuring that even floats (e.g., 2.0, 4.0) are included in the average calculation.  The modulo operator `%` works correctly with floats.\n",
      "* **Clearer Variable Names:** Uses more descriptive variable names (e.g., `even_numbers` instead of just `evens`).\n",
      "* **Example Usage with Output:**  Includes example usage with `print` statements to demonstrate how to use the function and what the expected output should be.  This makes it easy to test the code.  The examples cover different scenarios, including empty lists and lists with no even numbers.\n",
      "* **Robust Error Handling:** The check for an empty `even_numbers` list *before* attempting to calculate the average is crucial for preventing runtime errors. This makes the code significantly more robust.\n",
      "* **Correctness:**  The code now calculates the average correctly in all cases, including when the list contains only even numbers, only odd numbers, or is empty.\n",
      "* **Readability:**  The code is formatted consistently and is easy to read and understand.\n",
