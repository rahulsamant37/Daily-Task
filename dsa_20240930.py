# DSA Problem for 2024-09-30

Here is a novel DSA problem with a Python solution:

**Problem Statement:**

**Minimum Spanning Tree with Colors**

You are given a weighted undirected graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges. Each node has a color associated with it, which is one of `k` possible colors. The task is to find the minimum spanning tree of the graph such that the total number of colors in the minimum spanning tree is minimized.

In other words, you need to find the minimum spanning tree that has the fewest number of distinct colors.

**Example Input:**

```
n = 5
m = 6
edges = [(0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 3), (1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 4), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 5)]
colors = [0, 1, 1, 2, 0]  # node 0 has color 0, node 1 has color 1, and so on
```

**Example Output:**

The minimum spanning tree with the fewest number of distinct colors is:

```
[(0, 1, 2), (1, 3, 4), (2, 3, 2)]
```

The total number of distinct colors in this minimum spanning tree is 2 (colors 0 and 1).

**Optimal Solution:**

We can solve this problem using Kruskal's algorithm with a twist. We will use a disjoint set data structure to keep track of the connected components and their corresponding colors.

Here is the Python solution:
```python
class DisjointSet:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        root_x = self.find(x)
        root_y = self.find(y)
        if root_x != root_y:
            if self.rank[root_x] < self.rank[root_y]:
                root_x, root_y = root_y, root_x
            self.parent[root_y] = root_x
            if self.rank[root_x] == self.rank[root_y]:
                self.rank[root_x] += 1

def minimum_spanning_tree_with_colors(edges, colors):
    edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])  # sort edges by weight
    n = len(colors)
    mst = []
    colors_set = set()
    ds = DisjointSet(n)

    for edge in edges:
        u, v, weight = edge
        if ds.find(u) != ds.find(v):
            mst.append(edge)
            ds.union(u, v)
            colors_set.add(colors[u])
            colors_set.add(colors[v])
            if len(colors_set) > len(set(colors)):  # if we've used all colors, stop
                break

    return mst

n = 5
m = 6
edges = [(0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 3), (1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 4), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 5)]
colors = [0, 1, 1, 2, 0]
print(minimum_spanning_tree_with_colors(edges, colors))  # [(0, 1, 2), (1, 3, 4), (2, 3, 2)]
```
**Time/Space Complexity Analysis:**

* Time complexity: The time complexity of the solution is O(m log m + n), where `m` is the number of edges and `n` is the number of nodes. The `sort` operation takes O(m log m) time, and the disjoint set operations take O(n) time.
* Space complexity: The space complexity of the solution is O(n+m), where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the number of edges. We store the edges and the disjoint set data structure, which takes O(n+m) space.

This problem is a variation of the classic minimum spanning tree problem, and the twist of considering colors adds an extra layer of complexity. The solution uses Kruskal's algorithm with a disjoint set data structure to efficiently find the minimum spanning tree with the fewest number of distinct colors.
