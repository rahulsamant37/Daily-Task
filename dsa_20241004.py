# DSA Problem for 2024-10-04

Here's a novel DSA problem with a Python solution for 2024-10-04:

**Problem Statement:**

You are given a list of integers representing the prices of different stocks on different days. You can buy and sell stocks multiple times, but you must sell a stock before buying it again. You want to maximize your profit. However, there's a twist - you can only hold at most `k` stocks at any given time. Design an algorithm to find the maximum possible profit.

**Example:**

Input: `prices = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9], k = 2`
Output: `6` (Buy at 5, sell at 8, buy at 7, sell at 11)

**Optimal Solution:**

Here's a Python solution using dynamic programming:
```python
def max_profit_with_k_stocks(prices, k):
    n = len(prices)
    dp = [[[0] * 2 for _ in range(k + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            dp[i][j][0] = max(dp[i - 1][j][0], dp[i - 1][j][1] + prices[i - 1])
            dp[i][j][1] = max(dp[i - 1][j][1], dp[i - 1][j - 1][0] - prices[i - 1])

    return dp[n][k][0]
```
**Explanation:**

The solution uses a 3D DP table `dp` of size `(n + 1) x (k + 1) x 2`, where:

* `dp[i][j][0]` represents the maximum profit after `i` days, holding `j` stocks, and not holding any stock on the `i`-th day.
* `dp[i][j][1]` represents the maximum profit after `i` days, holding `j` stocks, and holding a stock on the `i`-th day.

The recurrence relations are:

* `dp[i][j][0] = max(dp[i - 1][j][0], dp[i - 1][j][1] + prices[i - 1])`: We can either not hold a stock on the `i`-th day (same as `dp[i - 1][j][0]`) or sell a stock on the `i`-th day (add `prices[i - 1]` to `dp[i - 1][j][1]`).
* `dp[i][j][1] = max(dp[i - 1][j][1], dp[i - 1][j - 1][0] - prices[i - 1])`: We can either hold a stock on the `i`-th day (same as `dp[i - 1][j][1]`) or buy a stock on the `i`-th day (subtract `prices[i - 1]` from `dp[i - 1][j - 1][0]`).

The final answer is `dp[n][k][0]`.

**Time/Space Complexity Analysis:**

* Time complexity: O(n \* k), where n is the number of days and k is the maximum number of stocks that can be held.
* Space complexity: O(n \* k), for the DP table.

Note that the time and space complexities are both linear in `n` and `k`, making this solution scalable for large inputs.
