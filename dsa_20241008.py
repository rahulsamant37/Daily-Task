# DSA Problem for 2024-10-08

Here is a novel DSA problem with a Python solution for 2024-10-08:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a binary tree, find the maximum sum of a subtree that is a palindrome. A subtree is a palindrome if the preorder traversal of the subtree forms a palindrome.

**Example:**

Input:
```
         1
        / \
       2   3
      / \   \
     4   5   1
```
Output: 7 (The subtree rooted at node 2 is a palindrome with sum 7: 2 + 4 + 5)

**Optimal Solution:**
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def max_palindrome_sum(root):
    def is_palindrome(traversal):
        return traversal == traversal[::-1]

    def preorder_traversal(node):
        if not node:
            return []
        return [node.val] + preorder_traversal(node.left) + preorder_traversal(node.right)

    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            return 0
        traversal = preorder_traversal(node)
        if is_palindrome(traversal):
            return sum(traversal)
        return max(dfs(node.left), dfs(node.right))

    return dfs(root)
```
**Time/Space Complexity Analysis:**

* Time complexity: O(n^2) where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The `preorder_traversal` function takes O(n) time to traverse the subtree, and we call it recursively for each node. The `is_palindrome` function takes O(n) time to check if the traversal is a palindrome. We call `dfs` recursively for each node, which takes O(n) time.
* Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We store the preorder traversal of each subtree in memory, which takes O(n) space. We also use recursive function calls, which take O(n) space on the call stack.

**Explanation:**

The solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree. For each node, we compute the preorder traversal of the subtree rooted at that node using the `preorder_traversal` function. We then check if the traversal is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function. If it is, we return the sum of the traversal. If not, we recursively call `dfs` on the left and right subtrees and return the maximum sum.

The `preorder_traversal` function uses a recursive approach to traverse the subtree rooted at a given node. It returns a list of node values in preorder traversal order.

The `is_palindrome` function takes a list of node values and checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.

Note that this solution has a high time complexity due to the recursive function calls and the palindrome check. For large trees, this solution may be inefficient. A more efficient solution might involve using a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to memoize the results of subtree traversals.
