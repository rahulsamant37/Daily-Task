# DSA Problem for 2024-10-16

Here is a novel DSA problem with a Python solution for 2024-10-16:

**Problem Statement:**

You are given a circular array of integers, where each element represents the maximum jump distance from that index. You can jump from an index to another index if the difference between the two indices is less than or equal to the maximum jump distance at the starting index. Your goal is to find the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index of the circular array.

For example, given the circular array `[2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1]`, you can reach the last index with a minimum of 3 jumps: `0 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6`.

**Optimal Solution:**
```python
def min_jumps(circular_array):
    n = len(circular_array)
    jumps = [float('inf')] * n
    jumps[0] = 0

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, min(i + circular_array[i] + 1, n)):
            jumps[j] = min(jumps[j], jumps[i] + 1)

    return jumps[-1]
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the circular array. This is because we have a nested loop structure that iterates over the array. The outer loop iterates over each element in the array, and the inner loop iterates over a range of indices that are within the maximum jump distance from the current index.

**Space Complexity Analysis:**

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the circular array. This is because we need to store the minimum number of jumps required to reach each index in the array.

**Example:**

```
circular_array = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1]
print(min_jumps(circular_array))  # Output: 3
```
This solution uses dynamic programming to build up a table of minimum jumps required to reach each index in the array. The table is initialized with infinity for all indices except the first one, which is set to 0. Then, we iterate over the array and update the table by considering the minimum number of jumps required to reach each index from the previous indices.

Note that this problem is similar to the "Jump Game II" problem, but with a circular array twist.
