# DSA Problem for 2024-10-17

Here is a novel DSA problem for 2024-10-17 with a Python solution:

**Problem Statement:**

**Maximum Subarray Sum with K Replacements**

Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, find the maximum sum of a subarray that can be obtained by replacing at most `k` elements in the array.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= k <= arr.length`
* `-10^5 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`

**Example:**

Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 2`
Output: `14`
Explanation: Replace the first two elements with `5` and `5` to get the maximum sum subarray `[5, 5, 3, 4, 5]` with sum `14`.

**Optimal Solution:**
```python
def max_subarray_sum_with_k_replacements(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, min(i, k) + 1):
            if j == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(arr[i - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1] + arr[i - 1])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j - 1] + arr[i - 1], dp[i - 1][j] + arr[i - 1])

    return max(dp[n][j] for j in range(k + 1))
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the optimal solution is O(nk), where `n` is the length of the input array and `k` is the number of replacements allowed. This is because we have a nested loop structure that iterates `n` times and has a maximum of `k` iterations in the inner loop.

**Space Complexity Analysis:**

The space complexity of the optimal solution is O(nk), which is the size of the 2D DP table `dp` that we use to store the maximum sum of subarrays with up to `j` replacements for each prefix of the input array.

**Explanation:**

The idea behind the solution is to use dynamic programming to build a table `dp` that stores the maximum sum of subarrays with up to `j` replacements for each prefix of the input array. We iterate through the input array and for each element, we consider two options:

1. Replace the current element with a new value (if we have remaining replacements).
2. Do not replace the current element and take the maximum sum from the previous prefix.

We use the `dp` table to store the maximum sum of subarrays with up to `j` replacements for each prefix of the input array, and finally return the maximum sum of subarrays with up to `k` replacements.

This problem is a variation of the classic Maximum Subarray problem with an additional twist of allowing up to `k` replacements, which requires a more sophisticated DP approach to solve efficiently.
