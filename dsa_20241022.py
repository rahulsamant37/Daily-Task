# DSA Problem for 2024-10-22

Here's a novel DSA problem with a Python solution for 2024-10-22:

**Problem Statement:**

**"Maximize the Number of Boxes in a Warehouse"**

You are the manager of a warehouse that stores boxes of different sizes. Each box can be stacked on top of another box if it is either smaller or of the same size. You want to maximize the number of boxes that can be stored in the warehouse. However, there's a catch - each box has a weight capacity, and the total weight of the boxes stacked on top of each other cannot exceed the weight capacity of the box at the bottom of the stack.

You are given a list of boxes, where each box is represented as a tuple of two integers: `(size, weight_capacity)`. Your task is to write a function that returns the maximum number of boxes that can be stacked in the warehouse.

**Example Input:**

```
boxes = [(3, 10), (2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 15), (2, 7)]
```

**Example Output:**

```
4
```

**Explanation:**

The optimal stacking order is: `(1, 2)`, `(2, 5)`, `(2, 7)`, `(4, 15)`. The total weight of the boxes stacked on top of each other does not exceed the weight capacity of the box at the bottom of the stack.

**Optimal Solution:**

Here's the Python solution using dynamic programming:
```python
def max_boxes(boxes):
    boxes.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)  # Sort boxes by size in descending order

    dp = [1] * len(boxes)  # Initialize dp array with 1, as each box can be stacked alone

    for i in range(1, len(boxes)):
        for j in range(i):
            if boxes[i][0] <= boxes[j][0] and boxes[i][1] <= boxes[j][1]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    return max(dp)
```

**Time/Space Complexity Analysis:**

* Time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of boxes. This is because we have a nested loop that iterates over the boxes array.
* Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of boxes. This is because we use a dp array of size n to store the maximum number of boxes that can be stacked.

**Explanation of the Solution:**

We first sort the boxes by size in descending order. Then, we initialize a dp array with 1, as each box can be stacked alone. We iterate over the boxes and for each box, we check if it can be stacked on top of a previous box by checking if the size and weight capacity of the current box are less than or equal to the size and weight capacity of the previous box. If so, we update the dp value for the current box to be the maximum of its current value and the dp value of the previous box plus 1. Finally, we return the maximum value in the dp array, which represents the maximum number of boxes that can be stacked in the warehouse.
