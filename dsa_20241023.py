# DSA Problem for 2024-10-23

Here is a novel DSA problem for 2024-10-23:

**Problem Statement:**

You are given a list of integers, `tasks`, where each integer represents the time required to complete a task. You have `k` identical robots that can work on these tasks simultaneously. The robots can start working on tasks at any time, but once a robot starts working on a task, it cannot switch to another task until the current task is completed. Your goal is to minimize the total time required to complete all tasks.

**Example:**

`tasks = [3, 2, 4, 1, 5]`, `k = 2`

Output: `6`

Explanation: The optimal strategy is to assign tasks `3` and `2` to robot 1, and tasks `4`, `1`, and `5` to robot 2. The total time required is `max(3+2, 4+1+5) = 6`.

**Optimal Solution:**
```python
import heapq

def min_time_to_complete_tasks(tasks, k):
    task_heap = []
    for task in tasks:
        heapq.heappush(task_heap, task)

    robots = [0] * k
    heapq.heapify(robots)

    while task_heap:
        for _ in range(k):
            if not task_heap:
                break
            task_time = heapq.heappop(task_heap)
            robot_time = heapq.heappop(robots)
            robot_time += task_time
            heapq.heappush(robots, robot_time)

    return max(robots)
```
**Time/Space Complexity Analysis:**

* Time complexity: O(n log k), where `n` is the number of tasks. We iterate over the tasks once to build the heap, and then we iterate over the tasks again to assign them to robots. The heap operations (push and pop) take O(log k) time.
* Space complexity: O(k), where `k` is the number of robots. We use a heap to store the robot times, which takes O(k) space.

The key insight to this problem is to use a heap to efficiently assign tasks to robots and keep track of the robot times. We use a min-heap to store the task times and a min-heap to store the robot times. We iterate over the tasks and assign them to the robots with the shortest available time, ensuring that we minimize the total time required to complete all tasks.
