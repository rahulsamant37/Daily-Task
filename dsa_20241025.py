# DSA Problem for 2024-10-25

Here is a novel DSA problem with a Python solution for 2024-10-25:

**Problem Statement:**

**String Concatenation with Minimum Cost**

Given a list of strings `words` and a 2D cost matrix `cost`, where `cost[i][j]` represents the cost of concatenating the `i-th` and `j-th` strings in `words`, write a function to find the minimum total cost of concatenating all the strings in `words` in a specific order.

The concatenation order is defined as follows: the first string is concatenated with the second string, then the resulting string is concatenated with the third string, and so on.

**Example:**

`words = ["ab", "cd", "ef", "gh"]`
`cost = [[0, 2, 3, 1], [2, 0, 4, 5], [3, 4, 0, 2], [1, 5, 2, 0]]`

In this example, the minimum total cost of concatenating all the strings is 7, which can be achieved by concatenating the strings in the order "ab" -> "abcd" -> "abcdefgh".

**Optimal Solution:**
```python
def min_cost_concatenation(words, cost):
    n = len(words)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]
    dp[0][0] = 0

    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i][i] = 0
        for j in range(i):
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[j][j] + cost[j][i] + len(words[j]) * len(words[i]))

    return min(dp[-1])

words = ["ab", "cd", "ef", "gh"]
cost = [[0, 2, 3, 1], [2, 0, 4, 5], [3, 4, 0, 2], [1, 5, 2, 0]]
print(min_cost_concatenation(words, cost))  # Output: 7
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of strings in `words`. This is because we have a nested loop structure with two loops iterating over the range `n`.

**Space Complexity Analysis:**

The space complexity of the solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of strings in `words`. This is because we are using a 2D array `dp` of size n x n to store the minimum costs of concatenating substrings.

**Explanation:**

The solution uses dynamic programming to build up a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost of concatenating the first `i` strings in `words` with the last string being `words[j]`.

The base case is when `i == j`, in which case the cost is 0 because we are not concatenating any strings.

For `i > j`, we consider all possible ways of concatenating the first `i` strings and choose the one with the minimum cost. We use the previously computed values in `dp` to compute the minimum cost of concatenating the first `j` strings and then add the cost of concatenating `words[j]` with `words[i]`.

Finally, we return the minimum cost of concatenating all the strings in `words`, which is stored in `dp[-1]`.
