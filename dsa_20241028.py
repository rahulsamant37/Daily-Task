# DSA Problem for 2024-10-28

Here is a novel DSA problem with a Python solution for 2024-10-28:

**Problem Statement:**

**Maximum Subarray Sum with Constraints**

Given an array of integers `arr` and two integers `k` and `m`, find the maximum sum of a subarray of length `k` such that the sum of the elements in the subarray is divisible by `m`.

For example, if `arr = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]`, `k = 3`, and `m = 6`, the maximum sum of a subarray of length `k` that is divisible by `m` is `36` (from the subarray `[6, 12, 18]`).

Write a function `max_subarray_sum(arr, k, m)` that returns the maximum sum of a subarray of length `k` that is divisible by `m`.

**Optimal Solution:**
```python
def max_subarray_sum(arr, k, m):
    n = len(arr)
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + arr[i]
    
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    for i in range(k, n + 1):
        for j in range(i - k, -1, -1):
            subarray_sum = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]
            if subarray_sum % m == 0:
                max_sum = max(max_sum, subarray_sum)
    
    return max_sum
```
**Time/Space Complexity Analysis:**

* Time complexity: O(n^2) where n is the length of the input array. The outer loop iterates over the array to calculate the prefix sum, and the inner loop iterates over the array to find the maximum sum of a subarray of length `k` that is divisible by `m`.
* Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input array. We store the prefix sum array of size `n + 1`.

Note: This problem can be optimized further using techniques like dynamic programming or hashing, but the above solution provides a basic outline of the approach.
