# DSA Problem for 2024-11-05

Here is a novel DSA problem with a Python solution for 2024-11-05:

**Problem Statement:**

**Maximum Sum Path in a Rotating Matrix**

Given a 2D matrix of integers `mat` and an integer `k`, find the maximum sum of a path in the matrix that can be traversed by rotating the matrix `k` times. A path can only move either right or down from a cell, and the rotation of the matrix is done in a clockwise direction.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= mat.length, mat[0].length <= 100`
* `1 <= k <= 1000`
* `-1000 <= mat[i][j] <= 1000`

**Example:**

Input: `mat = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`, `k = 2`
Output: `29`

Explanation:
Rotate the matrix 2 times:
```
[[1, 2, 3]] -> [[3, 2, 1]] -> [[9, 8, 7]]
[[4, 5, 6]] -> [[6, 5, 4]] -> [[8, 5, 4]]
[[7, 8, 9]] -> [[9, 8, 7]] -> [[7, 8, 9]]
```
The maximum sum path is `9 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`, which sums up to `29`.

**Optimal Solution:**

Here is a Python solution using dynamic programming and memoization:
```python
def max_sum_path(mat, k):
    m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
    dp = [[[0] * n for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(k + 1)]

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            dp[0][i][j] = mat[i][j]

    for rot in range(1, k + 1):
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if i == 0:
                    dp[rot][i][j] = max(dp[rot - 1][i][j], dp[rot - 1][i + 1][j - 1] + mat[i][j])
                elif j == 0:
                    dp[rot][i][j] = max(dp[rot - 1][i][j], dp[rot - 1][i - 1][j + 1] + mat[i][j])
                else:
                    dp[rot][i][j] = max(dp[rot - 1][i][j], dp[rot - 1][i + 1][j - 1] + mat[i][j], dp[rot - 1][i - 1][j + 1] + mat[i][j])

    return max(max(row) for row in dp[k])
```
**Time and Space Complexity Analysis:**

* Time complexity: O(k \* m \* n), where k is the number of rotations, and m and n are the dimensions of the matrix.
* Space complexity: O(k \* m \* n), where k is the number of rotations, and m and n are the dimensions of the matrix.

The solution uses a 3D DP table to store the maximum sum of paths for each rotation, and the maximum sum is updated using the previous rotation's values. The time and space complexity are both O(k \* m \* n) because we need to iterate over the DP table k times, and each iteration takes O(m \* n) time.
