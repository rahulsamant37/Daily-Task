# DSA Problem for 2024-11-14

Here is a novel DSA problem with a Python solution for 2024-11-14:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a list of integers representing the lengths of rods, and an integer `k` representing the maximum number of rods that can be cut from each rod, find the maximum number of rods that can be cut from the given list of rods such that the total length of the cut rods is equal to or less than a given integer `target`.

**Example:**

Input: `rods = [5, 3, 2, 4], k = 2, target = 10`
Output: `4`

Explanation: We can cut 2 rods of length 5, 1 rod of length 3, and 1 rod of length 2 to get a total length of 10.

**Optimal Solution:**
```python
def max_rods(rods, k, target):
    dp = [0] * (target + 1)
    for rod in rods:
        for j in range(target, rod - 1, -1):
            for i in range(1, min(k + 1, j // rod) + 1):
                dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - i * rod] + i)
    return dp[target]
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the above solution is O(n \* target \* k), where n is the number of rods. This is because we have three nested loops: one iterating over the rods, one iterating over the target from `target` to `rod` in reverse order, and one iterating over the number of times each rod can be cut (up to `k` times).

**Space Complexity Analysis:**

The space complexity of the above solution is O(target), which is the size of the dynamic programming array `dp`. We only need to store the maximum number of rods that can be cut for each possible total length up to the target.

**Explanation:**

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming, where we build up a table `dp` that stores the maximum number of rods that can be cut for each possible total length up to the target. We iterate over each rod and for each possible total length, we try to cut the rod as many times as possible (up to `k` times) and update the maximum number of rods that can be cut.

The key insight is to iterate over the target in reverse order, so that we can use the previously computed values in the `dp` table to compute the maximum number of rods that can be cut for the current total length.

This problem is similar to the 0/1 Knapsack problem, but with an additional constraint on the maximum number of times each rod can be cut. The dynamic programming solution takes into account this constraint and finds the optimal solution in polynomial time.
