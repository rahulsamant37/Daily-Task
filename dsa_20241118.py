# DSA Problem for 2024-11-18

Here is a novel DSA problem with a Python solution for 2024-11-18:

**Problem Statement:**

You are given a 2D matrix `grid` of size `m x n` where each cell can have one of three values:

* `0`: representing an empty cell
* `1`: representing a wall
* `2`: representing a target cell

You can move either horizontally or vertically from one cell to another. You cannot move diagonally. You want to find the shortest path from the top-left cell `(0, 0)` to the target cell `(i, j)` where `grid[i][j] == 2`. If there is no path to the target cell, return `-1`.

The twist is that you can only move through the grid in a "snake-like" pattern, meaning you can only move in one direction (either horizontally or vertically) and then switch directions. For example, if you move horizontally to the right, your next move must be vertically up or down, and then your next move must be horizontally left or right, and so on.

**Optimal Solution:**
```python
from collections import deque

def shortest_snake_path(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]  # right, left, down, up
    queue = deque([(0, 0, 0, 0)])  # x, y, dir, step
    visited = {(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1)}  # (x, y, dir)

    while queue:
        x, y, dir, step = queue.popleft()
        if grid[x][y] == 2:
            return step

        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if (0 <= nx < m) and (0 <= ny < n) and grid[nx][ny] != 1:
                ndir = (dir + 1) % 2 if dx == 0 else (dir + 2) % 2
                if (nx, ny, ndir) not in visited:
                    queue.append((nx, ny, ndir, step + 1))
                    visited.add((nx, ny, ndir))

    return -1
```
**Time/Space Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(m \* n) because we visit each cell in the grid at most twice (once for each direction). The space complexity is O(m \* n) because we store all the visited cells in the `visited` set.

The tricky part of this problem is handling the "snake-like" movement constraint. We use a queue to keep track of the cells to visit and their corresponding directions. We also use a `visited` set to avoid revisiting cells with the same direction. The `directions` list and the `(dir + 1) % 2` and `(dir + 2) % 2` calculations ensure that we alternate between horizontal and vertical movements.

This problem combines elements of BFS, graph traversal, and movement constraints, making it a challenging and novel DSA problem for 2024-11-18.
