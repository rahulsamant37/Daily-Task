# DSA Problem for 2024-11-21

Here is a novel DSA problem with a Python solution for 2024-11-21:

**Problem Statement:**

**Maximum Subarray Sum with K Replacements**

Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, find the maximum sum of a subarray that can be obtained by replacing at most `k` elements with any integer value.

**Example:**

Input: `arr = [2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 6, 7], k = 2`
Output: `23` (replace 1 and 3 with 7 and 6, respectively, to get the subarray `[2, 7, 7, 5, 4, 6, 7]` with sum 23)

**Optimal Solution:**
```python
def max_subarray_sum_with_replacements(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + arr[i]

    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, min(i, k) + 1):
            max_sum = float('-inf')
            for m in range(i):
                max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[m][j - 1] + prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[m])
            dp[i][j] = max_sum

    return dp[n][k]
```
**Time/Space Complexity Analysis:**

* Time complexity: O(n^2 \* k), where n is the length of the input array `arr`. The outer loop iterates over the array, and the middle loop iterates over the number of replacements `k`. The inner loop has a complexity of O(n) due to the prefix sum calculation.
* Space complexity: O(n \* k), where n is the length of the input array `arr`. We need to store the dynamic programming table `dp` of size (n + 1) x (k + 1).

**Explanation:**

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We maintain a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum sum of a subarray of length `i` with at most `j` replacements. We fill the table in a bottom-up manner.

For each subarray of length `i`, we consider all possible subarrays of length `m` (where `m <= i`) and calculate the maximum sum by replacing at most `j` elements. We use the prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of the subarray.

Finally, we return the maximum sum obtained with at most `k` replacements.

Note that this problem is a variation of the classic "Maximum Subarray Sum" problem, but with an additional twist of allowing replacements. The solution presented here has a higher time complexity than the traditional Kadane's algorithm, but it's still efficient enough to solve the problem optimally.
