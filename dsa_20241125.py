# DSA Problem for 2024-11-25

Here is a novel DSA problem with a Python solution for 2024-11-25:

**Problem Statement:**

**Triangle of Strings**

Given a list of strings, create a function that forms a triangle of strings, where each row of the triangle contains one more string than the previous row. The strings in each row should be in lexicographic (alphabetical) order. If a string is already present in a previous row, it should not be included in the current row.

For example, if the input list is `["abc", "def", "abc", "ghi", "jkl", "def", "mno"]`, the output should be:
```
abc
abc def
abc def ghi
abc def ghi jkl
abc def ghi jkl mno
```
**Optimal Solution:**
```python
def triangle_of_strings(strings):
    triangle = []
    seen = set()
    for s in sorted(strings):
        if s not in seen:
            triangle.append(s)
            seen.add(s)
            if len(triangle) > 1:
                triangle[-1] = ' '.join(sorted(triangle))
    return '\n'.join(triangle)
```
**Time/Space Complexity Analysis:**

* Time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we sort the input list, which takes O(n log n) time, and then iterate over the sorted list, which takes O(n) time.
* Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input list. We store the triangle of strings, which takes O(n) space, and a set of seen strings, which takes O(n) space in the worst case.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. We start by initializing an empty list `triangle` to store the triangle of strings, and a set `seen` to keep track of strings we've already seen.
2. We sort the input list of strings in lexicographic order.
3. We iterate over the sorted list, and for each string, we check if it's not already in the `seen` set. If it's not, we add it to the `triangle` list and mark it as seen.
4. If the `triangle` list has more than one element, we update the last element of the list to be the sorted concatenation of all strings in the list. This ensures that each row of the triangle is in lexicographic order.
5. Finally, we join the `triangle` list with newline characters and return the resulting string.

Note that this solution assumes that the input list is not too large to fit in memory, and that the length of each string is reasonable. If the input list is very large, a more efficient solution might be needed.
