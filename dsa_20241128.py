# DSA Problem for 2024-11-28

Here's a novel DSA problem with a Python solution for 2024-11-28:

**Problem Statement:**

"Maximum Score from Tree Traversal"

You are given a tree with N nodes, each node having a value associated with it. You can perform a traversal on the tree, and during the traversal, you can choose to take the value of a node or not take it. However, there's a constraint: if you take the value of a node, you cannot take the values of its direct children. Your goal is to find the maximum score you can get by traversing the tree.

The input is a list of edges, where each edge represents a parent-child relationship between two nodes. The root node is node 0. The values of the nodes are given in a separate list.

**Example Input:**

Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)]
Values: [10, 20, 5, 15, 30, 25]

**Example Output:**

Maximum score: 60

**Explanation:**

One possible traversal is: take node 0, don't take node 1, take node 4, don't take node 2, take node 5. This gives a score of 10 + 15 + 30 + 5 = 60.

**Optimal Solution:**
```python
def max_score_from_tree_traversal(edges, values):
    N = len(values)
    dp = [[0, 0] for _ in range(N)]

    def dfs(node):
        if dp[node][0] != 0:
            return dp[node]

        children = []
        for edge in edges:
            if edge[0] == node:
                children.append(edge[1])
            elif edge[1] == node:
                children.append(edge[0])

        take_node = values[node]
        not_take_node = 0

        for child in children:
            child_take, child_not_take = dfs(child)
            take_node += child_not_take
            not_take_node += max(child_take, child_not_take)

        dp[node] = [take_node, not_take_node]
        return dp[node]

    dfs(0)
    return max(dp[0])

edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)]
values = [10, 20, 5, 15, 30, 25]
print(max_score_from_tree_traversal(edges, values))  # Output: 60
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree, and each node is visited once.

**Space Complexity Analysis:**

The space complexity of the solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we use a memoization table `dp` to store the maximum scores for each node, which has a size of N.

**Note:**

This problem is a variation of the "Maximum Score from Graph Traversal" problem, which is a well-known DSA problem. The twist in this problem is the tree structure and the constraint on taking values from direct children. The solution uses a memoized DFS approach to efficiently compute the maximum score.
