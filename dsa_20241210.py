# DSA Problem for 2024-12-10

Here is a novel DSA problem with a Python solution for 2024-12-10:

**Problem Statement:**

**"Santa's Gift Wrapping"**

Santa Claus is preparing for the holiday season and needs help wrapping gifts for all the good boys and girls. He has a set of colorful wrapping papers of different sizes and a list of gifts with their respective sizes. Each gift can be wrapped with a wrapping paper of the same size or larger. Santa wants to minimize the total amount of wrapping paper used. Given the sizes of the gifts and the wrapping papers, determine the minimum total area of wrapping paper required to wrap all the gifts.

**Input:**

* `gifts`: a list of integers representing the sizes of the gifts
* `papers`: a list of integers representing the sizes of the wrapping papers

**Output:**

* The minimum total area of wrapping paper required to wrap all the gifts

**Example:**

* `gifts = [2, 3, 5, 7]`
* `papers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
* Output: `34` (Explanation: Santa can wrap the gifts as follows: gift 2 with paper 2, gift 3 with paper 3, gift 5 with paper 6, and gift 7 with paper 8, resulting in a total wrapping paper area of 2\*2 + 3\*3 + 5\*6 + 7\*8 = 34)

**Optimal Solution:**
```python
def santa_gift_wrapping(gifts, papers):
    gifts.sort()  # sort gifts in ascending order
    papers.sort()  # sort papers in ascending order
    i, j = 0, 0  # indices for gifts and papers
    total_area = 0

    while i < len(gifts):
        while j < len(papers) and papers[j] < gifts[i]:
            j += 1  # skip papers that are too small
        if j < len(papers):
            total_area += gifts[i] * papers[j]  # wrap gift with current paper
            i += 1
        else:
            break  # no more papers left, cannot wrap all gifts

    return total_area
```
**Time/Space Complexity Analysis:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n log n + m log m), where n is the number of gifts and m is the number of papers. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting steps, which take O(n log n) and O(m log m) time, respectively. The wrapping process itself takes O(n + m) time.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a few extra variables to store the indices and the total area, which does not depend on the input size.

This problem requires a combination of sorting and greedy algorithm techniques to solve efficiently.
