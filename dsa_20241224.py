# DSA Problem for 2024-12-24

Here is a novel DSA problem for 2024-12-24:

**Problem Statement:**

**Gift Wrapping Problem**

It's Christmas Eve, and you're in charge of wrapping gifts for the entire town. You have a list of gifts with their dimensions (length, width, and height) and a list of wrapping papers with their dimensions (length and width). Your task is to find the minimum number of wrapping papers required to wrap all the gifts.

A wrapping paper can wrap a gift if the paper's length is greater than or equal to the gift's diagonal length (calculated as sqrt(length^2 + width^2 + height^2)) and the paper's width is greater than or equal to the gift's maximum dimension (max(length, width, height)).

**Input:**

* `gifts`: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the dimensions of a gift (length, width, height).
* `papers`: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the dimensions of a wrapping paper (length, width).

**Output:**

* The minimum number of wrapping papers required to wrap all the gifts.

**Example:**

```
gifts = [(3, 2, 1), (4, 3, 2), (5, 4, 3)]
papers = [(10, 8), (12, 10), (15, 12)]

Output: 2
```

**Explanation:**

Gift 1 requires a paper with a length of at least sqrt(3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(14) and a width of at least max(3, 2, 1) = 3. Paper (10, 8) can wrap Gift 1.

Gift 2 requires a paper with a length of at least sqrt(4^2 + 3^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(29) and a width of at least max(4, 3, 2) = 4. Paper (12, 10) can wrap Gift 2 and Gift 3.

Therefore, the minimum number of wrapping papers required is 2.

**Optimal Solution:**
```python
import math

def gift_wrapping(gifts, papers):
    papers.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))  # Sort papers by length and width
    gifts.sort(key=lambda x: (math.sqrt(sum(i**2 for i in x)), max(x)))  # Sort gifts by diagonal length and max dimension

    paper_idx = 0
    wrapped_gifts = 0
    min_papers = 0

    for gift in gifts:
        while paper_idx < len(papers) and not can_wrap(gift, papers[paper_idx]):
            paper_idx += 1
        if paper_idx < len(papers):
            wrapped_gifts += 1
            min_papers = max(min_papers, wrapped_gifts)
        else:
            wrapped_gifts = 0

    return min_papers

def can_wrap(gift, paper):
    diagonal_length = math.sqrt(sum(i**2 for i in gift))
    max_dim = max(gift)
    return paper[0] >= diagonal_length and paper[1] >= max_dim
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the solution is O(n log n + m log m), where n is the number of gifts and m is the number of wrapping papers. This is because we sort both the gifts and papers, which takes O(n log n) and O(m log m) time, respectively. The subsequent iteration over the gifts and papers takes O(n + m) time.

**Space Complexity Analysis:**

The space complexity of the solution is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the sorted lists of gifts and papers, and the indices for the papers.

Note that this problem can be further optimized by using a binary search approach to find the minimum number of wrapping papers required, but the provided solution is a simple and intuitive approach to the problem.
