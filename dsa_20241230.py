**Problem Statement:**

**Elf's Gift Wrapping Problem**

It's Christmas Eve, and the elves at the North Pole are busy wrapping gifts for children all around the world. Each gift has a specific size and shape, and the elves need to wrap them in a specific order to minimize waste and maximize efficiency.

You are given a list of gifts, each represented by a tuple of three integers: `(width, height, area)`. The width and height of each gift are positive integers, and the area is the product of the width and height.

The elves have a special wrapping paper that can be cut into rectangles of any size. However, they can only cut the paper in whole units (i.e., they cannot cut a piece of paper into fractions of an inch). The wrapping paper has a fixed width `W` and a fixed height `H`.

Write a function `wrap_gifts(gifts, W, H)` that takes a list of gifts and the wrapping paper dimensions as input, and returns the minimum number of wrapping paper rectangles needed to wrap all the gifts. If it is not possible to wrap all the gifts with the given wrapping paper, return `-1`.

**Optimal Solution:**
```python
def wrap_gifts(gifts, W, H):
    gifts.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)  # Sort gifts by area in descending order

    paper_rectangles = [(W, H)]  # Initialize wrapping paper rectangles

    for gift in gifts:
        width, height, area = gift
        wrapped = False

        for i, (pw, ph) in enumerate(paper_rectangles):
            if pw >= width and ph >= height:
                # Wrap gift with existing rectangle
                paper_rectangles[i] = (pw - width, ph)
                wrapped = True
                break
            elif pw >= height and ph >= width:
                # Rotate gift and wrap with existing rectangle
                paper_rectangles[i] = (pw - height, ph)
                wrapped = True
                break

        if not wrapped:
            # Create a new wrapping paper rectangle
            paper_rectangles.append((width, height))

    return len(paper_rectangles)
```
**Time/Space Complexity Analysis:**

Time complexity:

* Sorting the gifts by area: O(n log n)
* Iterating through the gifts and wrapping paper rectangles: O(n^2)
* Overall time complexity: O(n^2)

Space complexity:

* Storing the gifts and wrapping paper rectangles: O(n)
* Overall space complexity: O(n)

Note that the time complexity can be improved by using a more efficient data structure, such as a binary search tree, to store the wrapping paper rectangles. However, the provided solution has a reasonable time complexity for most practical inputs.

I hope this problem and solution help!
