Here's a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a 2D matrix of characters, find the longest common prefix among all the strings in each row. If there's no common prefix, return an empty string. The matrix can have varying number of rows and columns, and the strings within the matrix can also vary in length.

**Example Input:**
```
matrix = [
    ["abcd", "abce", "abcg"],
    ["pqrs", "pqrt", "pqru"],
    ["xyz", "xyy", "xya"]
]
```
**Example Output:**
```
["abc", "pqr", "xy"]
```
**Solution Code:**
```python
def longest_common_prefix(matrix):
    result = []
    for row in matrix:
        prefix = ""
        for chars in zip(*row):
            if len(set(chars)) == 1:
                prefix += chars[0]
            else:
                break
        result.append(prefix)
    return result

matrix = [
    ["abcd", "abce", "abcg"],
    ["pqrs", "pqrt", "pqru"],
    ["xyz", "xyy", "xya"]
]

print(longest_common_prefix(matrix))  # Output: ["abc", "pqr", "xy"]
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(m \* n \* k), where:

* m is the number of rows in the matrix
* n is the average length of the strings in each row
* k is the average length of the longest common prefix in each row

The reason for this complexity is that we're iterating over each row, and for each row, we're iterating over the characters in each string using the `zip` function, which has a complexity of O(n). Then, we're checking if all characters in a column are the same using a `set`, which has a complexity of O(k). Finally, we're iterating over the resulting list of prefixes, which has a complexity of O(m).

Note that this solution assumes that the input matrix is not extremely large, and the strings within the matrix are not extremely long. If the input matrix is very large, a more efficient solution might be needed.
