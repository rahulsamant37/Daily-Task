Here is a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a binary tree, write a function to find the maximum sum of a path that starts at the root, goes down to a leaf node, and then back up to the root again. The path must pass through at least one leaf node.

**Example:**

```
     1
    / \
   2   3
  / \   \
 4   5   6
```

The maximum sum of a path that starts at the root, goes down to a leaf node, and then back up to the root again is 1 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 11.

**Solution Code:**

```
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def max_path_sum(root):
    def helper(node):
        nonlocal max_sum
        if not node:
            return 0
        left = max(0, helper(node.left))
        right = max(0, helper(node.right))
        max_sum = max(max_sum, node.val + left + right)
        return node.val + max(left, right)

    max_sum = float('-inf')
    helper(root)
    return max_sum

# Example usage:
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)
root.right.right = TreeNode(6)

print(max_path_sum(root))  # Output: 11
```

**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once in the recursive helper function.

The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree, due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case, the tree is skewed and the height is n, but in the average case, the height is log(n) for a balanced binary tree.

Note that this problem is similar to the "Maximum Path Sum" problem, but with the additional constraint that the path must pass through at least one leaf node. This makes the problem more challenging, as we need to keep track of the maximum sum of a path that starts at the root and goes down to a leaf node, and then back up to the root again.
