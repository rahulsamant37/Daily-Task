Here is a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a list of intervals, where each interval is represented as a tuple of two integers (start, end), write a function to find the maximum number of intervals that can be merged into a single interval. Two intervals can be merged if they overlap, i.e., the end of one interval is greater than or equal to the start of the other interval.

**Example:**

Input: `[(1, 3), (2, 4), (5, 7), (6, 8), (9, 10)]`

Output: `3` (because we can merge intervals `(1, 3)` and `(2, 4)` into one, and intervals `(5, 7)` and `(6, 8)` into another, and `(9, 10)` remains separate)

**Solution Code:**
```python
def max_merged_intervals(intervals):
    # Sort the intervals by their start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    merged_intervals = []
    current_interval = intervals[0]

    for interval in intervals[1:]:
        # If the current interval overlaps with the next interval, merge them
        if current_interval[1] >= interval[0]:
            current_interval = (current_interval[0], max(current_interval[1], interval[1]))
        else:
            # Add the current interval to the merged list and move to the next interval
            merged_intervals.append(current_interval)
            current_interval = interval

    merged_intervals.append(current_interval)

    return len(merged_intervals)
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals.

Here's why:

* We sort the intervals, which takes O(n log n) time.
* We then iterate through the sorted intervals, which takes O(n) time.
* In the worst case, we might need to merge all intervals, which would also take O(n) time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n) + O(n) = O(n log n).

Note that the sorting step dominates the time complexity, so we can ignore the O(n) term.
