Here is a unique DSA problem in Python with a solution:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a list of strings, where each string represents a directory path, write a function to find all the directories that are subdirectories of another directory in the list. A subdirectory is a directory that is entirely contained within another directory. For example, `/a/b/c` is a subdirectory of `/a/b`.

**Solution Code:**
```python
def find_subdirectories(directory_list):
    subdirectories = {}
    for directory in directory_list:
        for other_directory in directory_list:
            if directory != other_directory and directory.startswith(other_directory):
                if other_directory not in subdirectories:
                    subdirectories[other_directory] = []
                subdirectories[other_directory].append(directory)
    return subdirectories
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list `directory_list`. This is because we have a nested loop structure, where each iteration of the outer loop iterates over the entire list again. In the worst case, we have to compare each directory with every other directory, resulting in a quadratic time complexity.

However, we can optimize this solution to O(n log n) by sorting the input list first and then using a more efficient algorithm to find subdirectories. Here's an updated solution:
```python
def find_subdirectories(directory_list):
    directory_list.sort()
    subdirectories = {}
    for i, directory in enumerate(directory_list):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(directory_list)):
            if directory_list[j].startswith(directory):
                if directory not in subdirectories:
                    subdirectories[directory] = []
                subdirectories[directory].append(directory_list[j])
    return subdirectories
```
In this optimized solution, we first sort the input list, which takes O(n log n) time. Then, we iterate over the list once, and for each directory, we iterate over the remaining directories in the list to find subdirectories. Since we're iterating over a sorted list, we can stop iterating over the inner loop once we find a subdirectory, which reduces the number of comparisons. This optimization reduces the time complexity to O(n log n).

**Example Input and Output:**

Input: `["/a/b", "/a/b/c", "/a/d", "/e/f", "/e/f/g", "/h/i"]`

Output: `{"/a/b": ["/a/b/c"], "/e/f": ["/e/f/g"]}`

Note that the output is a dictionary where each key is a directory, and the value is a list of its subdirectories.
