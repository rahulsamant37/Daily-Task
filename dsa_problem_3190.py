Here's a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

You are given a 2D grid of characters, where each character is either '0' (representing an empty cell) or '1' (representing a house). Your task is to write a function that finds the maximum number of houses that can be connected to each other in the grid, considering that two houses are connected if they share a common side (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally).

**Example Input:**

```
grid = [
    ['1', '0', '1', '0'],
    ['0', '1', '0', '1'],
    ['1', '1', '0', '0'],
    ['0', '0', '1', '1']
]
```

**Expected Output:**

`4`

**Solution Code:**
```python
def max_connected_houses(grid):
    def dfs(i, j):
        if i < 0 or i >= len(grid) or j < 0 or j >= len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] != '1':
            return 0
        grid[i][j] = '0'  # mark as visited
        count = 1
        count += dfs(i-1, j)  # up
        count += dfs(i+1, j)  # down
        count += dfs(i, j-1)  # left
        count += dfs(i, j+1)  # right
        return count

    max_count = 0
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] == '1':
                count = dfs(i, j)
                max_count = max(max_count, count)

    return max_count
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the solution is O(M\*N), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns in the grid.

Here's a breakdown of the time complexity:

* The outer loop iterates over each cell in the grid, which takes O(M\*N) time.
* For each cell, we perform a depth-first search (DFS) to count the connected houses. The DFS has a maximum depth of M+N, since we can only move up, down, left, or right. Therefore, the time complexity of the DFS is O(M+N).
* Since we perform the DFS for each cell, the total time complexity is O(M\*N) \* O(M+N) = O(M\*N).

However, since M+N is a constant factor, we can ignore it and simplify the time complexity to O(M\*N).

Note that the space complexity is O(M+N) due to the recursive call stack used in the DFS.
