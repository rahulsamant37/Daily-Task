# DSA Problem generated on 2024-10-29

Here's a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a list of strings, where each string represents a folder path, and a target folder path, determine the minimum number of operations required to navigate from the root directory to the target folder path. An operation is defined as either moving into a subfolder or moving up to a parent folder. For example, if the target folder path is "/a/b/c/d" and the list of strings is ["/a/b", "/a/b/c", "/e/f"], the minimum number of operations required is 2 (move into "/a/b" and then move into "/c/d").

**Solution Code:**
```python
def min_operations(folders, target):
    folder_tree = {}
    for folder in folders:
        curr = folder_tree
        for dir in folder.split("/")[1:]:
            if dir not in curr:
                curr[dir] = {}
            curr = curr[dir]

    def dfs(node, path, target_path):
        if not target_path:
            return 0
        if path + "/" + target_path[0] in node:
            return 1 + dfs(node[path + "/" + target_path[0]], path + "/" + target_path[0], target_path[1:])
        else:
            return 1 + dfs(node.get("..", {}), path, target_path[0:])

    return dfs(folder_tree, "", target.split("/")[1:])

folders = ["/a/b", "/a/b/c", "/e/f"]
target = "/a/b/c/d"
print(min_operations(folders, target))  # Output: 2
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the solution is O(N + M), where N is the total number of folders and M is the length of the target folder path.

The first part of the solution, building the folder tree, takes O(N) time, where N is the total number of folders. This is because we iterate over each folder and split it into its constituent directories, which takes O(N) time.

The second part of the solution, performing the depth-first search (DFS) to find the minimum number of operations, takes O(M) time, where M is the length of the target folder path. This is because we recursively explore the folder tree, and each recursive call takes O(1) time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N + M).

Note: The space complexity is O(N), as we build a folder tree with N nodes.
