**Problem Statement:**

**Maximize the Sum of Subarray Elements by Rotating the Array**

Given an array of integers, rotate the array by some number of positions to maximize the sum of elements in a subarray of a fixed length. The rotation is circular, meaning that the last element of the array becomes the first element after rotation. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and we rotate it by 2 positions, the resulting array would be `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.

Write a function `max_subarray_sum` that takes as input the array, the subarray length, and the number of positions to rotate, and returns the maximum sum of elements in the subarray after rotation.

**Solution Code:**
```python
def max_subarray_sum(arr, subarray_len, rotate_positions):
    n = len(arr)
    max_sum = float('-inf')

    # Calculate the sum of the original array
    original_sum = sum(arr)

    # Rotate the array and calculate the sum of subarray
    for _ in range(rotate_positions):
        arr = arr[-1:] + arr[:-1]
        subarray_sum = sum(arr[:subarray_len])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, subarray_sum)

    # Calculate the sum of the subarray for the remaining positions
    for i in range(n - subarray_len + 1):
        subarray_sum = sum(arr[i:i + subarray_len])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, subarray_sum)

    return max(max_sum, original_sum)
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

Here's a breakdown of the time complexity:

* The first loop iterates `rotate_positions` times, which is a constant. In each iteration, we rotate the array and calculate the sum of the subarray, which takes O(1) time.
* The second loop iterates `n - subarray_len + 1` times, which is O(n). In each iteration, we calculate the sum of the subarray, which takes O(1) time.

Since the two loops are independent, the total time complexity is O(n).

Note that the space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum sum and the sum of the original array.
