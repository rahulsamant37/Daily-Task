Here is a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

You are given a list of strings, where each string represents a directory path. Your task is to find the maximum depth of the directory tree. The depth of a directory is defined as the number of slashes in its path.

For example, the directory path "/a/b/c" has a depth of 2, while the directory path "/a/b/c/d/e" has a depth of 4.

**Solution Code:**
```
def max_directory_depth(dir_paths):
    max_depth = 0
    for path in dir_paths:
        depth = path.count('/')
        max_depth = max(max_depth, depth)
    return max_depth

# Test the function
dir_paths = ["/a/b/c", "/a/b", "/a/b/c/d/e", "/f/g", "/h/i/j/k/l"]
print(max_directory_depth(dir_paths))  # Output: 4
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of directory paths and m is the maximum length of a directory path.

Here's a breakdown of the time complexity:

* The outer loop iterates over the list of directory paths, which takes O(n) time.
* For each directory path, we use the `count()` method to count the number of slashes, which takes O(m) time in the worst case (when the directory path has the maximum number of slashes).
* The `max()` function is used to update the maximum depth, which takes O(1) time.

Since the `count()` method is called for each directory path, the overall time complexity is O(n*m).

Note: This solution assumes that the input directory paths are valid and do not contain duplicate slashes (e.g., "//a//b"). If the input may contain invalid directory paths, additional error handling may be necessary.
