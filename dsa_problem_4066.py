Here is a unique DSA problem in Python with solution:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a list of strings, where each string represents a path of directories, write a function to find the longest common prefix among all the paths. The paths can contain multiple directories separated by '/'. For example, if the input is `["/a/b/c", "/a/b/d", "/a/e/f"]`, the function should return `"/a"` as the longest common prefix.

**Solution Code:**
```
def longest_common_prefix(paths):
    if not paths:
        return ""

    # Split each path into a list of directories
    dir_lists = [path.split("/") for path in paths]

    # Find the minimum length of the directory lists
    min_len = min(len(dl) for dl in dir_lists)

    # Initialize the longest common prefix
    common_prefix = []

    # Iterate through each directory level
    for i in range(min_len):
        # Get the current directory at this level for each path
        dirs = [dl[i] for dl in dir_lists]

        # If all directories at this level are the same, add it to the common prefix
        if len(set(dirs)) == 1:
            common_prefix.append(dirs[0])
        else:
            break

    # Join the common prefix directories with '/' and return
    return "/" + "/".join(common_prefix)
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of paths and m is the average length of each path.

Here's a breakdown of the time complexity:

* Splitting each path into a list of directories takes O(m) time for each path, so O(n*m) in total.
* Finding the minimum length of the directory lists takes O(n) time.
* Iterating through each directory level takes O(m) time, and within each iteration, we perform a set operation to check if all directories are the same, which takes O(n) time. Since we do this for at most m iterations, the total time complexity is O(n*m).
* Joining the common prefix directories with '/' takes O(m) time.

Since the dominant term is O(n*m), the overall time complexity is O(n*m).

Note: This solution assumes that the input paths are valid and do not contain empty strings or directories. If such cases need to be handled, additional checks and error handling would be required.
