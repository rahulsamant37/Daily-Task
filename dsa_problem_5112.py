Here is a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a list of intervals, where each interval is represented as a list of two integers [start, end], write a function to merge overlapping intervals. The intervals can be overlapping, and the function should return a list of merged intervals.

For example, if the input is `[[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]`, the output should be `[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]`.

**Solution Code:**
```
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return []

    # Sort the intervals by start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    merged_intervals = [intervals[0]]

    for interval in intervals[1:]:
        if interval[0] <= merged_intervals[-1][1]:
            # Merge the current interval with the last merged interval
            merged_intervals[-1][1] = max(merged_intervals[-1][1], interval[1])
        else:
            # Add the current interval to the list of merged intervals
            merged_intervals.append(interval)

    return merged_intervals
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals.

Here's a breakdown of the time complexity:

* Sorting the intervals takes O(n log n) time using the built-in `sort` method.
* The loop that iterates over the intervals takes O(n) time.
* Inside the loop, we perform a constant-time operation to check if the current interval overlaps with the last merged interval, and update the last merged interval if necessary.

Since the sorting step dominates the time complexity, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

Note that this solution assumes that the input intervals are valid, i.e., each interval has a start time less than or equal to its end time. If the input intervals can be invalid, additional error handling would be necessary.
