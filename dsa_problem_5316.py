Here is a unique DSA problem in Python with solution:

**Problem Statement:**

**Maximize the Sum of Pairwise Hamming Distances**

Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of pairwise Hamming distances between all pairs of elements in the array. The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

For example, the Hamming distance between 1 (001) and 4 (100) is 3, because the bits at the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd positions are different.

**Solution Code:**
```python
def max_hamming_distance_sum(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            hamming_distance = bin(arr[i] ^ arr[j]).count('1')
            max_sum += hamming_distance
    return max_sum
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the above solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we have a nested loop structure that iterates over all pairs of elements in the array, resulting in a quadratic number of operations.

To be more precise, the time complexity can be broken down as follows:

* The outer loop iterates n times.
* The inner loop iterates (n - i - 1) times for each iteration of the outer loop.
* The Hamming distance calculation using the `^` operator and `bin()` function takes O(1) time.
* The `count()` method on the resulting binary string takes O(m) time, where m is the number of bits in the Hamming distance. Since m is at most 32 for 32-bit integers, we can assume m is a constant.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n^2), which can be slow for large input arrays.

**Note:** This problem can be optimized using more advanced techniques, such as using a bitwise Trie data structure or a dynamic programming approach, to reduce the time complexity. However, the above solution is a simple and intuitive approach that demonstrates the basic concept of Hamming distances.
