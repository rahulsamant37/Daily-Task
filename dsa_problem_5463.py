Here's a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a list of strings, where each string represents a sequence of parentheses, determine the maximum length of a valid parentheses sequence that can be formed by concatenating the given strings. A valid parentheses sequence is one where every open parenthesis has a corresponding close parenthesis and vice versa.

**Example:**

Input: `["(()", ")()", "()()"]`

Output: `6` (because the longest valid parentheses sequence is "()()()()" which can be formed by concatenating the given strings)

**Solution Code:**
```python
def max_valid_parentheses(seq):
    max_len = 0
    stack = []
    for s in seq:
        for c in s:
            if c == '(':
                stack.append(c)
            elif c == ')':
                if stack and stack[-1] == '(':
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append(c)
        while stack and stack[-1] == '(':
            stack.pop()
        max_len = max(max_len, len(stack))
    return max_len
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the total number of characters in the input sequence of strings.

Here's the breakdown:

* We iterate through each string in the input sequence, which takes O(m) time, where m is the number of strings.
* For each string, we iterate through each character, which takes O(k) time, where k is the average length of each string.
* Within each character iteration, we perform a constant-time operation (push or pop from the stack).
* Finally, we perform a single pass through the stack to count the maximum length of valid parentheses, which takes O(n) time.

Since the number of strings (m) and the average length of each string (k) are bounded by the total number of characters (n), the overall time complexity is O(n).

Note that this solution assumes that the input sequence of strings is not too large, and the stack operations are performed in constant time. If the input sequence is very large, a more efficient data structure might be needed to store the parentheses sequence.
