Here is a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a string of parentheses, write a function to find the longest valid parentheses sequence. A valid parentheses sequence is defined as a sequence where every open parenthesis can be closed by a corresponding closing parenthesis. For example, "(())()" is a valid sequence, but "))(" is not.

**Example Input/Output:**

* Input: "(()(()"
* Output: "(()())" ( longest valid parentheses sequence)
* Input: "))("
* Output: "" (no valid sequence)

**Solution Code:**
```python
def longest_valid_parentheses(s):
    stack = []
    max_len = 0
    max_seq = ""

    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        if c == "(":
            stack.append(i)
        elif c == ")":
            if stack:
                open_idx = stack.pop()
                seq = s[open_idx:i+1]
                if len(seq) > max_len:
                    max_len = len(seq)
                    max_seq = seq
            else:
                stack.append(i)  # push the index of the unbalanced closing parenthesis

    return max_seq
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate through the input string only once, and the operations inside the loop (pushing and popping from the stack, checking the length of the sequence, and updating the maximum length and sequence) are all constant time operations.

The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case, we might need to store all indices in the stack (e.g., when the input string is all closing parentheses).

Note that this solution uses a stack to keep track of the open parentheses and their indices, which allows us to efficiently find the longest valid parentheses sequence. The stack is used to simulate the recursive function calls that would be needed to solve this problem recursively.
