Here's a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a string `s` containing only lowercase alphabets, find the minimum number of operations required to make the string palindrome. An operation is defined as swapping two characters in the string.

**Example:**

Input: `s = "abcba"`
Output: `0` (since the string is already a palindrome)

Input: `s = "abcd"`
Output: `2` (we need to swap 'b' with 'd' and 'a' with 'c' to make the string "abdc" which is a palindrome)

**Solution Code:**
```python
def min_operations_to_palindrome(s):
    n = len(s)
    operations = 0
    left, right = 0, n - 1

    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            operations += 1
            temp = s[left]
            s = s[:left] + s[right] + s[left + 1:right] + temp + s[right + 1:]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        else:
            left += 1
            right -= 1

    return operations
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the above solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. Here's why:

* We iterate through the string from both ends (left and right) until they meet in the middle.
* In the worst case, we might need to perform one operation for each character in the string (i.e., when the string is not a palindrome at all).
* The swapping operation takes constant time, O(1).
* The loop runs at most `n/2` times, since we're iterating from both ends.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n), which is efficient for large input strings.

Note that this problem is a variant of the "Minimum Number of Operations to Make a Palindrome" problem, which is a common problem in competitive programming. However, the twist here is that we're allowed to swap characters, which makes the problem slightly different and more interesting.
