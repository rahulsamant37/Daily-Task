Problem Statement:

**Find the Maximum Sum of a Subarray with at most K Replacements**

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, find the maximum sum of a subarray that can be obtained by replacing at most `k` elements in the subarray.

For example, if `nums = [1, 2, -3, 4, -5, 6]` and `k = 2`, the maximum sum of a subarray that can be obtained by replacing at most 2 elements is `14` (by replacing `-3` and `-5` with `0` and getting the subarray `[1, 2, 0, 4, 0, 6]`).

Solution Code:
```python
def max_sum_subarray_with_replacements(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + nums[i]

    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, min(i, k) + 1):
            max_sum = float('-inf')
            for m in range(i):
                max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[m][j - 1] + prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[m])
            dp[i][j] = max_sum

    return dp[n][k]
```
Time Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the solution is O(n^2 \* k), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we have three nested loops:

* The outermost loop iterates `n` times.
* The middle loop iterates `min(i, k)` times, which is at most `k` times.
* The innermost loop iterates `i` times.

The space complexity is O(n \* k), which is the size of the `dp` table.

The key insight in this solution is to use dynamic programming to build up a table `dp` that stores the maximum sum of a subarray with at most `j` replacements for each prefix of the input array of length `i`. We update the table using the recurrence relation:

`dp[i][j] = max(dp[m][j - 1] + prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[m]) for m in range(i)`

This recurrence relation says that the maximum sum of a subarray with at most `j` replacements for a prefix of length `i` is the maximum of the maximum sums of subarrays with at most `j - 1` replacements for prefixes of length `m` (where `m < i`), plus the sum of the elements from `m` to `i` (which can be obtained using the prefix sum array).

By using this dynamic programming approach, we can avoid recomputing the maximum sum of subarrays multiple times and reduce the time complexity to O(n^2 \* k).
