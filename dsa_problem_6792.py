Here's a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

**Maximize the Profit from Stock Transactions**

You are given a list of integers representing the stock prices on consecutive days. You can perform at most `k` transactions (buy and sell operations) to maximize your profit. However, you must sell a stock before buying another one. Find the maximum profit you can achieve.

**Example:**

Input: `prices = [3, 2, 6, 5, 0, 3], k = 2`

Output: `7` (Buy at 2, sell at 6, buy at 0, sell at 3)

**Solution Code:**
```python
def max_profit(prices, k):
    n = len(prices)
    
    # base case: no transactions
    if k == 0 or n < 2:
        return 0
    
    # create a 2D DP table to store the maximum profit for each subproblem
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(k + 1)]
    
    # iterate over the number of transactions
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        # initialize the maximum profit for the first transaction
        max_profit_so_far = -prices[0]
        
        # iterate over the days
        for j in range(1, n):
            # update the maximum profit for the current transaction
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j - 1], prices[j] + max_profit_so_far)
            
            # update the maximum profit so far
            max_profit_so_far = max(max_profit_so_far, dp[i - 1][j] - prices[j])
    
    # return the maximum profit for the given number of transactions
    return dp[k][n - 1]
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the solution is O(nk), where `n` is the number of days and `k` is the maximum number of transactions. This is because we have a 2D DP table with `k + 1` rows and `n` columns, and we iterate over each cell in the table to compute the maximum profit.

The space complexity is O(nk), as we need to store the DP table to compute the maximum profit.

Note that the time complexity can be improved to O(n) using a more efficient algorithm, but the above solution is a simple and intuitive approach to demonstrate the concept of dynamic programming.
