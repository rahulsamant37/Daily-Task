Here is a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a string `s` containing only lowercase letters, find the minimum number of operations required to convert `s` into a palindrome. An operation is defined as swapping any two characters in the string.

**Example:**

* Input: `s = "abcba"`
* Output: 0 (since "abcba" is already a palindrome)
* Input: `s = "abcd"`
* Output: 2 (swap 'b' and 'd' to get "abdc", then swap 'c' and 'd' to get "abcd")

**Solution Code:**
```python
def min_ops_to_palindrome(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    left, right = 0, n - 1
    ops = 0

    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            ops += 1
            # Find the closest character to the left that matches the rightmost character
            for i in range(left + 1, right + 1):
                if s[i] == s[right]:
                    s = s[:i] + s[i + 1:] + s[i]
                    break
        left += 1
        right -= 1

    return ops
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because in the worst case, we need to iterate through the entire string to find a matching character for each mismatch.

Here's a breakdown of the time complexity:

* The outer while loop runs in O(n) time.
* The inner for loop runs in O(n) time in the worst case (when we need to iterate through the entire string to find a matching character).
* Since the inner loop is executed for each mismatch, the total time complexity is O(n) \* O(n) = O(n^2).

Note that this solution has a high time complexity due to the nested loops, but it is still efficient for small to medium-sized input strings. For very large input strings, a more efficient solution may be needed.
