Here's a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

You are given a string `s` consisting of only ` '(' `and ` ')' `characters. The string `s` represents a sequence of parentheses. A valid parentheses sequence is one where every open parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis. Your task is to find the longest valid parentheses sequence in the string `s`.

For example, if the input string is `"()(()"` , the longest valid parentheses sequence is `"()(()"` with a length of 4.

**Solution Code:**

```
def longest_valid_parentheses(s):
    n = len(s)
    stack = []
    max_len = 0
    temp = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            stack.append('(')
        else:
            if stack and stack[-1] == '(':
                stack.pop()
                temp += 2
                max_len = max(max_len, temp)
            else:
                temp = 0
    return max_len

# Test the function
print(longest_valid_parentheses("()(()"))  # Output: 4
```

**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we are making a single pass through the input string, and the operations performed within the loop (pushing and popping from the stack, incrementing the `temp` variable, and updating the `max_len` variable) take constant time.

The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case, the stack can store up to n elements if the input string consists only of open parentheses.
