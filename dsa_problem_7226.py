Here is a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a string `s` and a list of strings `words`, return the minimum number of deletions required to make `s` a subsequence of `words`. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.

For example, if `s = "abc"` and `words = ["ab", "bc", "ca"]`, the minimum number of deletions required is 1, because we can delete one character from `s` to make it a subsequence of `words`.

**Solution Code:**
```python
def min_deletions(s, words):
    m, n = len(s), len(words)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    for i in range(m + 1):
        dp[i][0] = i

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if s[i - 1] in words[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    return dp[m][n]
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the solution is O(m \* n), where `m` is the length of the string `s` and `n` is the length of the list `words`. This is because we have a nested loop structure where we iterate over each character in `s` and each word in `words`.

The space complexity is O(m \* n) as well, because we need to store the dynamic programming table `dp` which has size (m + 1) x (n + 1).

Note: This problem is a variation of the classic Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem, but with a twist. In LCS, we want to find the longest common subsequence between two strings, whereas here we want to find the minimum number of deletions required to make one string a subsequence of another. The dynamic programming approach is similar, but the recurrence relation is different.
