Here's a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a string `s` containing only lowercase letters, implement a function `max_chunks(s)` that returns the maximum number of chunks that can be formed from `s` such that each chunk is a palindrome. A chunk can be of any length, but it must be a contiguous subsequence of `s`.

**Example:**

Input: `s = "abaccbd"`
Output: `4`
Explanation: The maximum number of chunks is 4, which can be formed as follows: `["a", "ba", "cc", "bd"]`.

**Solution Code:**
```python
def max_chunks(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        max_chunks_seen = 0
        for j in range(i):
            if s[j:i] == s[j:i][::-1]:  # check if substring is palindrome
                max_chunks_seen = max(max_chunks_seen, dp[j] + 1)
        dp[i] = max_chunks_seen

    return dp[-1]
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the solution is O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we have two nested loops: the outer loop runs from 1 to `n`, and the inner loop runs from 0 to `i` (which is bounded by `n`). The palindrome check `s[j:i] == s[j:i][::-1]` takes O(k) time, where `k` is the length of the substring, but since `k` is bounded by `n`, we can ignore it in the analysis.

The space complexity is O(n), since we need to store the dynamic programming table `dp` of size `n + 1`.

Note: This problem can be optimized to O(n) time complexity using a more advanced approach, such as using a suffix tree or a Manacher's algorithm. However, the above solution is a simple and intuitive approach that demonstrates the use of dynamic programming.
