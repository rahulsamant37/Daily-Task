Here's a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

You are given a list of integers representing the prices of different stocks on a particular day. You can buy and sell a stock any number of times, but you must sell a stock before you can buy it again. However, you can only hold at most one stock at a time. Write a function to find the maximum possible profit you can make from these transactions.

**Constraints:**

* The input list will always contain at least one element.
* The input list will not exceed 10^5 elements.
* The elements in the input list will be in the range [0, 10^4].

**Example Input:**

`prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]`

**Expected Output:**

`7`

**Explanation:**

The maximum possible profit can be achieved by buying the stock at the price of 1, selling it at the price of 5, buying it again at the price of 3, and selling it again at the price of 6. This gives a total profit of 7.

**Solution Code:**
```
def max_profit(prices):
    profit = 0
    for i in range(1, len(prices)):
        if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
            profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
    return profit
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we are iterating over the input list only once.

The space complexity is O(1), which means the space required does not change with the size of the input, so it is constant.

**Explanation of the Solution:**

The idea behind this solution is to iterate over the input list and find all the local peaks and valleys. A local peak is a price that is higher than the previous one, and a local valley is a price that is lower than the previous one. We can make a profit by buying at a local valley and selling at a local peak.

In the solution code, we initialize a variable `profit` to 0, which will store the total profit. Then, we iterate over the input list starting from the second element (since we need to compare each element with the previous one). If the current element is greater than the previous one, it means we have a local peak, and we add the difference to the `profit` variable. This is because we can sell the stock at the higher price and buy it back at the lower price, making a profit.

By doing this, we are essentially finding all the local peaks and valleys and adding up the profits from each one. At the end of the iteration, the `profit` variable will contain the maximum possible profit.
