Here is a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a string `s` and a list of strings `wordDict`, write a function to return all possible sentences that can be formed by concatenating words from `wordDict` where the concatenation of words is equal to `s`. Each word in `wordDict` can be used multiple times.

**Example:**

Input: `s = "catsanddog"` and `wordDict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"]`
Output: `["cats and dog", "cat sand dog"]`

**Solution Code:**
```
def word_break(s, wordDict):
    def dfs(s, path, res):
        if s == "":
            res.append(" ".join(path))
            return
        for word in wordDict:
            if s.startswith(word):
                dfs(s[len(word):], path + [word], res)

    res = []
    dfs(s, [], res)
    return res

s = "catsanddog"
wordDict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"]
print(word_break(s, wordDict))  # Output: ["cats and dog", "cat sand dog"]
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of the solution is O(n \* m \* 2^n), where:

* n is the length of the input string `s`.
* m is the number of words in `wordDict`.
* 2^n is the number of possible sentences that can be formed by concatenating words from `wordDict`.

The DFS function has a recursive depth of up to n, and each recursive call iterates over the wordDict, which takes O(m) time. Additionally, each sentence formed by concatenating words from `wordDict` can be of length up to n, and there are 2^n possible sentences. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n \* m \* 2^n).

Note that the solution has an exponential time complexity, which can be improved using dynamic programming techniques. However, the above solution is a simple and intuitive approach to solve the problem.
