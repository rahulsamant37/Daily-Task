Here is a unique DSA problem in Python with solution:

** Problem Statement **

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, write a function to find the `k` most frequent characters in the string `s`. The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a character and its frequency in the string, sorted in descending order of frequency.

** Example **

Input: `s = "abcdeabcdeabcdeabcde", k = 3`
Output: `[('a', 5), ('b', 5), ('c', 5)]`

** Solution Code **
```
from collections import Counter
import heapq

def top_k_frequent(s, k):
    # Count the frequency of each character in the string
    freq = Counter(s)
    
    # Use a heap to find the top k frequent characters
    top_k = heapq.nlargest(k, freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    return top_k
```
** Time Complexity Analysis **

The time complexity of this solution can be broken down into two parts:

1. Counting the frequency of each character using `Counter`: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because `Counter` iterates over the entire string once.
2. Finding the top k frequent characters using `heapq.nlargest`: O(n log k), where n is the length of the string `s` and k is the desired number of top frequent characters. This is because `heapq.nlargest` uses a heap data structure to find the top k elements, which takes O(n log k) time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of this solution is O(n log k).

** Space Complexity Analysis **

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we store the frequency of each character in a dictionary (created by `Counter`), which takes O(n) space.

Note that the space complexity would be O(k) if we only stored the top k frequent characters, but in this case, we store all the frequencies, so the space complexity is O(n).
