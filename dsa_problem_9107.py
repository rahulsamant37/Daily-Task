Here's a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a list of integers, find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) that can be formed by concatenating the elements of the list in a specific order. The twist is that each element in the list can be either used as is or incremented by 1, but not both. For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4], the longest increasing subsequence that can be formed is [1, 2, 3, 4] or [1, 2, 4, 5] (by incrementing 4 to 5).

**Solution Code:**
```python
def longest_increasing_subsequence(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            if arr[i - 1] < arr[j - 1] or arr[i - 1] + 1 == arr[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1, dp[i - 1][j])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]

    lis_length = dp[n][n]
    lis = []
    i, j = n, n
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            lis.append(arr[i - 1])
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            i -= 1

    return lis_length, lis[::-1]

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
lis_length, lis = longest_increasing_subsequence(arr)
print("Longest increasing subsequence:", lis)
print("Length:", lis_length)
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list. The reason is that we have two nested loops, each of which iterates n times. The outer loop iterates over the elements of the list, and the inner loop iterates over the elements of the list again to find the longest increasing subsequence.

The space complexity is O(n^2) as well, since we use a 2D array `dp` to store the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences.

Note that the solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem efficiently. The `dp` array stores the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences for each subproblem, and we use these values to compute the solution for the original problem.
