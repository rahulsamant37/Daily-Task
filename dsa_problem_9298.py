Here's a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a list of integers, find the maximum sum of a subsequence that can be formed by selecting non-adjacent elements from the list. The subsequence must contain at least one element.

For example, given the list `[3, 2, 7, 10, 9, 1, 5]`, the maximum sum subsequence would be `[3, 7, 9, 5]` with a sum of `24`.

**Solution Code:**
```python
def max_sum_non_adjacent(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    elif len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]
    else:
        dp = [0] * len(nums)
        dp[0] = nums[0]
        dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])
        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])
        return dp[-1]
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we iterate through the list only once, using a dynamic programming approach to build up the maximum sum subsequence.

The space complexity is also O(n), as we need to store the dynamic programming table `dp` of size n.

Here's an explanation of the solution:

* We initialize the dynamic programming table `dp` with zeros, where `dp[i]` will store the maximum sum subsequence ending at index `i`.
* For the base cases, we set `dp[0]` to the first element of the list and `dp[1]` to the maximum of the first two elements.
* For each element `nums[i]` starting from the third element (index 2), we have two options:
	+ Take the maximum sum subsequence ending at the previous element `dp[i-1]`.
	+ Take the maximum sum subsequence ending two elements ago `dp[i-2]` and add the current element `nums[i]`.
	We choose the maximum of these two options and store it in `dp[i]`.
* Finally, we return the last element of the `dp` table, which represents the maximum sum subsequence.

Note that this problem is a variation of the classic "House Robber" problem, where we can't rob adjacent houses.
