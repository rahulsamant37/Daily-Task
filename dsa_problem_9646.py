Here is a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a list of integers, find the maximum sum of a subarray that contains at least one pair of identical elements. If no such subarray exists, return 0.

**Example:**

Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 1]`
Output: `9` (Maximum sum of subarray `[2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 1]` which has at least one pair of identical elements)

**Solution Code:**
```python
def max_sum_subarray_with_duplicates(arr):
    max_sum = 0
    seen = {}
    curr_sum = 0
    start = 0

    for end, num in enumerate(arr):
        if num in seen:
            # If we've seen this number before, update the start index
            start = max(start, seen[num] + 1)
        seen[num] = end

        # Calculate the current sum
        curr_sum += num

        # Update max sum if we have a larger sum
        max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)

        # If we have a sum that's greater than the maximum sum, update the maximum sum
        if curr_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = curr_sum

    return max_sum
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

Here's a breakdown of the time complexity:

* We iterate through the array once, so that's O(n) already.
* For each element, we perform a constant-time operation (checking if it's in the `seen` dictionary and updating the `start` index if necessary).
* We also perform a constant-time operation (calculating the current sum and updating the maximum sum if necessary).

Since we only iterate through the array once, and the operations inside the loop are constant-time, the overall time complexity is O(n).

Note that the space complexity is O(n) as well, since we store the indices of the elements in the `seen` dictionary.
