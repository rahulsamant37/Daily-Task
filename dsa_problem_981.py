Here is a unique DSA problem in Python:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a list of strings, find the longest common prefix among all the strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string. The twist is that each string in the list can have a limited number of wildcards '*' which can match any character.

For example, if the input list is `["hello*', "hell*", "he**o"]`, the output should be `"he"` because it is the longest common prefix among all the strings, taking into account the wildcards.

**Solution Code:**
```python
def longest_common_prefix(strings):
    if not strings:
        return ""
    prefix = ""
    for chars in zip(*strings):
        if len(set(chars)) == 1 or '*' in chars:
            prefix += chars[0]
        else:
            break
    return prefix
```
**Time Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the shortest string in the input list. This is because we are iterating over the characters of each string in parallel using the `zip` function, and we stop as soon as we find a mismatch or reach the end of the shortest string.

Here's a breakdown of the time complexity:

* The `zip` function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the shortest input iterable.
* The loop iterates over the characters of each string, which has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case.
* Inside the loop, we are doing a constant-time operation ( checking if all characters are the same or if '*' is present) for each character.
* Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).

**Example Usage:**
```python
strings = ["hello*", "hell*", "he**o"]
print(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: "he"

strings = ["abc", "abd", "abe"]
print(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: "ab"

strings = ["*", "a*", "b*"]
print(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: ""
```
Note that this solution assumes that the input list is not empty and that each string in the list is not empty. If these assumptions are not valid, additional error handling may be needed.
